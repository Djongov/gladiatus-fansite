Underworld Hard Difficulty
==========================

**Underworld** has 4 areas. Once you arrive, you are not there yet. The Hermit drops you off at the gates of the Underworld and from there you are on your own.

**The Areas are:**

***Entrance to the Kingdom of the Dead***

***Court of the Dead***

***Tartarus***

***Erebus***

Remember that Hard difficulty enemies are level 135

Entrance to the Kingdom of the Dead
===================================

You go to Entrance to the Kingdom of the Dead and you are ready to face your first 4 opponents

**Description**  
*"The old man brings you to a rocky crevasse, yet you must enter alone. You agonise: can you overcome yourself and take the first step into the Underworld? Will you ever see daylight again?"*  
   
Your first fight, no matter on what difference is actually fighting a mirrored image of yourself

This has proven to be a real problem because what are the chances to beat an exact copy of yourself in terms of stats and strength. Sometimes i beat myself from the first time, sometimes it takes me 5 tries. Not a good start for sure. If you buff yourself, your mirror image will also have the same stats, not some basic version of you.

Once you manage to defeat your other self it's time for your next opponent

**Description**

*"The first battle is complete, you have overcome your fears and stride confidently forwards. But after a short while a grand-looking man stands in your way. With a closer look you recognise the features of the god Mercury - he bears a winged helm and has the Mercury staff to his left. It is not in his nature to allow one of the living into the land of the dead."*

Mercury, is a major Roman god sitting within the ancient Roman pantheon. He is the god of messages, financial gain, trickery and luck. He is also the guide of souls to the underworld

Your next opponent are the Dead Souls themselves

**Description**

*"Much to your fortune, Mercury is no warrior and it does not take much to overwhelm him. He retreats out of the Underworld, but you should be careful: he will certainly be reporting back to the ruler of the dead. Suddenly a chill comes over you and your body is surrounded by a black fog. The shadows of the dead, who must tarry eternally on the river Acheron, claw at your very soul!"*

And finally you face the boss of the Entrance

Ferryman Charon is the ferryman of Hades who carries souls of the newly deceased across the rivers Styx and Acheron that divided the world of the living from the world of the dead

**Description**

*"You`re able to shake off the chill and lurking death, but immediately after, another horror awaits. An ancient yet large and powerful man looks toward you as you reach the Acheron`s shores. It becomes apparent in an instant that Charon will not be ferrying you across the river for all the gold in the world."*

This concludes your journey entering the Underworld. Next step is to enter Court of the Dead

---

Court of the Dead
=================

Court of the Dead is your first destination after entering the Underworld when Ferryman Charon is defeated

Your first opponent is Cerberus. Often called the "hound of Hades", is a monstrous multi-headed dog, who guards the gates of the underworld, preventing the dead from leaving

**Description**

*"After an arduous battle Charon accepts his defeat and grants you passage. But was that a good idea? From a distance you can see the silhouette of a giant beast. Cerberus is salivating at the prospect of gnawing your bones. It has been long since he has had to deny someone entry into the Underworld. You step onto land and he races towards you."*

Your next opponent is Aeacus. Aeacus was a mythological king of the island of Aegina in the Saronic Gulf. He was the father of Peleus, Telamon and Phocus and was the grandfather of Achilles and Telemonian Ajax. He and his 2 brothers are your next opponents and judges of the dead in the Court of the Dead.

**Description**

*"Bloody and breathless, you leave the hound behind you. You won in the battle for your life. As expected, the situation only gets worse for you in the Underworld and after a few metres your next hurdle presents itself - the three terrible brothers, descendant of Jupiter`s blood: Aeacus, Rhadamanthus and Minos, the judges of the dead. But you are not here to be sentenced, you walk only the path you choose for yourself. Aeacus, once King of Aegina, is your first opponent."*

Aecus is out, time to face the next brother

**Description**

*"Defeating Aeacus felt rather simple in comparison to Cerberus, but then the once King of Crete stepped before you. Rhadamanthus is disgusted by your disregard for the laws of the Underworld. He raises his weapon against you in front of the court."*

Rhadamanthus

And now the boss of the Court of the Dead. King Minos

**Description**

*"Rhadamanthus lies on the floor and your knees are quivering through the exertion. But there is still no respite: Minos, the King that once threw Rhadamanthus down from his throne, rises, slowly. A true giant, almost god-like. He wants to see you dead and then he will pass his judgement upon you. `To your eternal burning in Tartarus!` he roars in gravely tones and unleashes a gigantic snake on you."*

Tartarus
========

After Court of the Dead, Tartarus comes

Tartarus is the deep abyss that is used as a dungeon of torment and suffering for the wicked and as the prison for the Titans. As far below Hades as the earth is below the heavens, Tartarus is the place where, according to Plato in Gorgias (c. 400 BC), souls were judged after death and where the wicked received divine punishment. Like other primal entities (such as the Earth, Night and Time), Tartarus was also considered to be a primordial force or deity.

Your first opponent

**Description**

*"Only your cunning pulled you through the battle against the last of the three judges. You rest a moment before continuing, but naturally your pause is not long: suddenly the air starts to turn with a poisonous scent. You cover your face quickly with cloth, not a moment too soon. A few metres away, the Hydra thought dead rises and spreads a deadly poison with its breath."*

Hydra

Your next opponent is a terrifying being

Centimanes or also called Hekatonkheires were three giants of incredible strength and ferocity that surpassed all of the Titans, whom they helped overthrow. Their name dervices from the Greek word hekaton "Hundred" and Kheir "hand" each having a hundred hands and fifty heads. The 3 Hekatonkheires became the guards of the gates of Tartarus. The Hundred-Handed-Ones are "giants" of great storms, and hurricanes.

Centimanes were children of Gaia (Earth) and Uranus (sky). Their names are:  
 -Briareos (strong)  
 -Kottos (Strike,punch)  
 -Gyges (Limb,Curved)

**Description**

*"The hydra is headless and all its stumps charred. But what was the beast guarding? Tartarus, the worst of the worst places within the Underworld. You enter and are met immediately by a charging centimane. Gigantic, bigger than any titan. This battle is one you cannot win."*

Your next opponent is Tisiphone. Tisiphone (Vengeance), or Tilphousia, was one of the Erinyes or Furies, and sister of Alecto and Megaera. She was the one who punished crimes of murder: parricide, fratricide and homicide. In Book VI of Virgil's Aeneid, she is described as the guardian of the gates of Tartarus, 'clothed in a blood-wet dress'.\[According to one myth, she fell in love with a mortal, Cithaeron, but was spurned; in her anger she formed a poisonous snake from her hair, which bit and killed him.

**Description**

*"As if by miracle you defeat the might of the centimane. You seem to be getting stronger. Is there anything that can stop you? You take in your surroundings. You espy a woman on a pedestal... or is it a human-sized bat? Tisiphone`s gleaming eyes fix on you, no escape! The fury of retribution swings its whip in your direction."*

The boss on the gates of Tartarus is Typhon. Typhon was a monstrous giant and the most deadly being of Greek mythology. Typhon was the last son of Gaia, and was fathered by Tartarus. Typhon and his mate Echidna were the progenitors of many famous monsters.

**Description**

*"It took all your strength to tear the goddess of vengeance out of the air using her own whip. Your body has long lost its human power: a different force seems to now be pushing you forwards, leading you like the hand of a spirit straight into the fangs of Typhon. Your eyes have never seen something as grotesque. There is no way out, the monster attacks from all sides."*

Erebus
======

You are now entering Erebus. Erebus was often conceived as a primordial deity, representing the personification of darkness; for instance, Hesiod's Theogony identifies him as one of the first five beings in existence, born of Chaos.

The first opponent you find in Erebus is Proserpina. Proserpina is an ancient Roman goddess whose cult, myths and mysteries were based on those of Greek Persephone and her mother Demeter, the Greek goddess of grain and agriculture. The Romans identified Proserpina with their native fertility goddess Libera, daughter of the grain and agriculture goddess Ceres and wife to Liber. Proserpina is the wife of the underworld lord Dis Pater.

**Description**

*"You collapse, yet the monster follows suit in falling to the floor. It however, is lifeless. Blackness descends over your eyes... As you awaken, you are in a different place. A woman of great beauty stands before you and commands that you leave the Underworld. But you have not come this far for naught: your true opponent is still ahead. This woman is much stronger than expected and seems to have godly powers at her disposal."*

Your next opponent is Alecto and Magaera. The sisters of Tisiphone (Vengeance). Megaera (Jealousy) is the cause of jealousy and envy, and punishes people who commit crimes, especially marital infidelity. Like her sisters Alecto and Tisiphone, as well as the Melian Nymphs, she was born of the blood of Uranus when Cronus castrated him

**Description**

*"Using concentrated and monstrous strength you throw her to the ground, yet as her skin hits the stone you are met with the arrival of her mighty servants. Two horrendous furies swing their terrifying wings over your head and you realise that you have just defeated the Queen of the Underworld. Her husband cannot be far away. Alecto and Megaera are much more fearsome as a duo as their sister Tisiphone. You tense every muscle and prepare yourself for a hellish battle."*

Your next opponent is the Sphynx. Monster with the head of a woman, the wings of a griffin and the body of a lion. The Sphinx stopped travelers on the road to Thebes and posed them a riddle. If they answered wrong, they died. The hero Oedipus was asked the following question: "What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon and three at close of day?" Oedipus replied that a human crawls on four legs as an infant, walks upright on two in the prime of life and hobbles with a cane in old age. Hearing this, the Sphinx promptly ran off and killed herself. The grateful people of Thebes made Oedipus their king.

**Description**

*"As all three of the apparent female creatures lie on the floor, you have the time to take a look around you. You are in a grand chamber. But you are not alone. A figure sits on a tremendous stone throne at the end of the room. Before you get to pit your strength against the Lord of the Underworld however, his guard rises in front of you: the Sphinx."*

And at last you can now face the lord of the Underworld. Dis Pater was a Roman god of the underworld, later subsumed by Pluto or Hades (Hades was Greek). Originally a chthonic god of riches, fertile agricultural land, and underground mineral wealth, he was later commonly equated with the Roman deities Pluto and Orcus, becoming an underworld deity.In being conflated with Pluto, Dīs Pater took on some of the Greek mythological attributes of Pluto/Hades, being one of the three sons of Saturn (Greek: Cronus) and Ops, along with Jupiter and Neptune. He ruled the underworld and the dead beside his wife, Proserpina.

**Description**

*"The monstrosity stumbles with just a sole wing. You finally stand before your target: Dīs Pater has watched the whole thing and begins to applaud. `We could use a person of your talents around here. All the monsters that I sent were weaker than you. It seems that I may have to resolve this situation with my own two hands`. His voice puts your teeth on edge, but you have come too far to be daunted now. You fought through all of hell for this battle!"*
