Gladiatus costumes are giving bonuses to the one who wears them but with one rule - bonuses are not with direct benefits to the strength of the hero (it won't make you better at fighting)

There are 3 types of costumes:

- [Everywear Costumes](/costumes/everywear-costumes "Everywear Costumes") - The normal costumes. Can be found in Expeditions, Dungeons and Chest of Divine Fate or Daily rolls. Read more about them in this page below
