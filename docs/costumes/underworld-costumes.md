## Normal Costume

This costume is the reward from completing Underworld normal. Read more about it here [Underworld Normal](/underworld/underworld-normal "Underworld Normal")

- **Bonus 1:** Normal expedition points: 12 or 24 (Centurio) or 48 (Centurio + Blessing of Apollo pact). With Dis Pater Normal Costume: 24 or 48 (Centurio) or 72 (Centurio + Blessing of Apollo pact)
- **Bonus 2:** Activating the costume restores the expedition points to full. Make sure to spend them all and activate the costume on 0.
- **Bonus 3:** It increases the expedition points regeneration 3 times. This means that if your expedition points regenerate with 1 every 45 min (with Centurio), with Dis Pater Normal costume you will regenerate 1 expedition point every 15 minutes
- **Bonus 4 & 5:** Doubles the gold in expeditions. This can be further boosted with Mercury's Blessing pact. Also the item % drop chance becomes 100% so every kill = an item.

- **Bonus 6:** No durability or conditioning loss in expedition. This is good news as this amount of expedition you will be doing will damage your equipment and you will have to repair frequently
 
This costume, despite coming from the easiest Underworld difficulty is an essential part of the game. Provides basically endless amount of expeditions with tons of gold and therefore good for quick leveling. Make sure to have Blessing of Mercury while with this costume and you might switch is with Blessing of Apollo every 24 hours (twice during the duration of the costume)

Cons:

\- Hard to say what Cons such a great costume has. With such a high regeneration of expedition points and such high number of total expeditions you will feel tempted to try and play them all, resorting to Hourglass items which generally might cost you Rubies if you don't have enough of them

\- You will accumulate a lot of gold while farming expeditions with this costume so be aware of arena attacks. Make sure to have a good spending strategy. Use scrolls or deposits of amulet and rings. Sell them all, train a stat or more and start buying them off from the vendor one by one to spend your gold

\- Even with such a great costume you will still miss some of the ordinary costume bonuses like Neptun's Might or the Wrath's Mountain Scaled Armor. No strategy around that. 2 out of 5 days you will be wearing this and the rest of the days - normal costumes. Except for events. [Event Costumes](/events "Event Costumes") are also quite good and will make you wonder which to wear even more. Perhaps a combination of all during a festival event.

Example of the Gold dropped by Dragon, the boss in [Koman Mountain](/expeditions/germania-expeditions#KomanMountain "Koman Mountain") (Level 108):

## Medium Costume

This costume is the reward from completing Underworld medium. Read more about it here [Underworld Medium](/underworld/underworld-medium "Underworld Medium")

![Dis Pater Medium Costume stats](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Underworld/Dis_Pater_medium_Costume_stats.png "Dis Pater Medium Costume stats")

- **Bonus 1:** Normal dungeon points: 12 or 24 (with Centurio). With this they become 24 or 48 (with Centurio)
- **Bonus 2:** Same as Dis Pater Normal costume activating the costume will restore all your dungeon points to max so make sure to spend them all and active the costume when you have 0 left
- **Bonus 3:** Increases dungeon regeneration rate 3 times. Normal dungeon regeneration for 1 dungeon point is 1 hour 30 minutes for 1 dungeon point or 1 hour with Centurio. With this costume regeneration will be every 30 minutes or every 20 minutes with Centurio
- **Bonus 4:** Every opponent in a dungeon will drop an item guaranteed. Dungeon item drop rate is quite high anyway but this will make it a guaranteed item drop
- **Bonus 5:** Doubles the gold dropped in dungeons but that's not much to begin with. Not a huge increase. ~400-500 gold per dungeon opponent
- **Bonus 6:** No durability or conditioning loss in a dungeon. This is good news as this amount of dungeons you will be completing will damage your equipment and that of your followers and you will have to repair frequently. This solves the problem

Costume is equivalent of Dis Pater Normal but for dungeons. Of course Expeditions and Dungeons are quite different and so are the rewards. Personal opinion is that this costume is the weakest of all 3.

Cons:

- Does not provide the same gold, experience or honour as the rest of the costumes so in general weaker in rewards

## Hard Costume

This costume is the reward from completing Underworld hard. Read more about it here [Underworld Hard](/underworld/underworld-hard "Underworld Hard")

![Dis Pater Hard costume](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Underworld/Dis_Pater_hard_Costume.png "Dis Pater Hard costume")![Dis Pater Hard costume Female](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Underworld/Dis_Pater_Hard_Female.png "Dis Pater Hard costume Female")

![Dis Pater Hard costume stats](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Underworld/Dis_Pater_hard_Costume_stats.png "Dis Pater Hard costume stats")

- **Bonus 1 & 2:** Reduces the Arena and Circus cooldowns to just 1 minutes 15 seconds with Centurio
- **Bonus 3:** 3 times more ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold") from the periodic prize money for staying at Rank 1 in Arena or Circus Turma. See example below

![Dis Pater prize money](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Underworld/Dis_Pater_Hard_bonus_3.png "Dis Pater prize money")

- **Bonus 4:** 3 times larger jackpot for defeating rank 1 - See example below. 2x 1.6 million ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold") pots turned into 9.6 million ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold")

![Dis Pater hard jackpot](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Underworld/Dis_Pater_Hard_bbonus_6.png "Dis Pater hard jackpot")

- **Bonus 5:** No loss of durability or conditioning from arena fights. With this costume and the crazy arena cooldowns this is a must!
- **Bonus 6:** 11 times more Gold from wining an Arena or Circus Turma. This is the real deal !!!

![Dis Pater Hard costume bonus 3](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Underworld/Dis_Pater_hard_bonus2.jpg "Dis Pater Hard costume bonus 3")

- **Hidden bonus:** When you defeat Dis Pater on Hard - 1 free stat point with no gold cost. In high levels this is millions of Gold worth of a bonus

Really different from the other 2 costumes. Definitely the most value from all 3, especially if you are good stats and gear. If you are a very weak arena and circus player, Dis Pater normal can be more valuable

Cons:

- With 2 minute cooldowns on Arena and Circus you must be online constantly for the duration of the costume to get the most out of it. Can be tiring and time consuming

- Not as good as Normal Dis Pater costume if you are aiming for high experience gain. Expeditions bring more experience points than duels

- You will accumulate a lot of gold while farming expeditions with this costume so be aware of arena attacks. Make sure to have a good spending strategy. Use scrolls or deposits of amulet and rings. Sell them all, train a stat or more and start buying them off from the vendor one by one to spend your gold
