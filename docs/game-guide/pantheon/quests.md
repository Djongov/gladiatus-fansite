Quests are a fundamental part of the game. Quests can be with time limit (to be done within a certain time frame) or without expiration date.

---

## Quest Rewards

Quest rewards are:

- God favors (if the quest awards 0 god favor, it means that you are either at max favor for this god or have reached the daily limit)
- Gold
- Experience
- Honour
- Items (mostly food and up to **Green** quality items)

Quest rewards are increased as you level up. The higher your level is, the more ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold"), ![Honour](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_honor_small.gif "Honour"), ![Experience](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_level_small.gif "Experience") you receive.

## Quest Facts

- **Cooldown:** 30 minutes (lower on levels below 10) and you can have up to 5 active quests at one time
- You can cancel a quest at any time
- If you fail a quest due to expired time limit or failed succession, you can retry the quest for free
- You can reduce greatly the quest waiting time by using the Wrath Mountain costume + Secret Knowledge of the Ancients pact to just 5 minutes cooldown
- If you don't want to wait for the quest cooldown, you can reduce it by 10 minutes for the cost of 3 ![Rubies](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_rubies.gif "Rubies") or 3 ![Holy Hourglass](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Holy_Hourglass.png "Holy Hourglass"). If you have ![Holy Hourglass](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Holy_Hourglass.png "Holy Hourglass"), it always prevails over ![Rubies](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_rubies.gif "Rubies")
- If you switch between Centurio and no-Centurio, your quest timers for timed quests will be adjusted accordingly
- **Time limit quests** provide better rewards (more Gold, Honour, etc.): ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold"), ![Honour](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_honor_small.gif "Honour"), ![Experience](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_level_small.gif "Experience"), ![Items](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/icon_drop_small.gif "Items") and ![Mars favor](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/mars_favor.png "Mars favor") ![Diana favor](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/diana_favor.png "Diana favor") ![Apollo favor](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/apollo_favor.png "Apollo favor") ![Mercury favor](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/merkur_favor.png "Mercury favor") ![Minerva favor](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/minerva_favor.png "Minerva favor") ![Vulcanus favor](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/vulcanus_favor.png "Vulcanus favor")
- When you start playing in a new dungeon or expedition, the quest system will need some time to adjust to your current dungeon. If you find incorrect or inadequate quests after a country change or new expedition discovery, just give it some time

![Arena quests](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Quests/icon_arena_active.jpg "Arena quests")

Arena quests involve winning in the Arena and Arena Provinciarum. Most Arena quests are with a time limit. "Upgrade" battles means they should be legit battles in the Arena ranking, Provinciarum, or just attacking someone outside Arena but within your level range (-9/+9 levels). Note that quests always cover both server Arena and the cross-server Arena Provinciarum. There are 2 types:

### In Succession

![Arena quest - Succession](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Quests/Arena_succession.png "Arena quest - Succession")

### In Succession
