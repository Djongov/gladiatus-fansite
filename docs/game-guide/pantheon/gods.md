The Gods system is quite a big one and plays a significant role in Gladiatus. There are 6 Gods: Mars, Mercury, Diana, Apollo, Minerva, and Vulcan. The idea of the God system is to gather favor with the 6 gods individually and then spend this favor to activate buffs that boost certain stats on your character.

## Understanding the Gods Screen

![God System](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/god_system2.png "God System")

1. **God's Name and Favor:** Shows how much favor you have and the maximum favor you can obtain for this god. The absolute max god favor is 1000. Increasing your max god favor is achieved through completing Missions, so complete your missions immediately when you achieve them for maximum efficiency.

2. **God Icon:** This is the large icon representing the god. In-game you will see them mostly in their small icons: ![Mars favor](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/mars_favor.png "Mars favor") ![Diana favor](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/diana_favor.png "Diana favor") ![Apollo favor](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/apollo_favor.png "Apollo favor") ![Mercury favor](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/merkur_favor.png "Mercury favor") ![Minerva favor](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/minerva_favor.png "Minerva favor") ![Vulcanus favor](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/vulcanus_favor.png "Vulcanus favor")

3. **Daily Favor Limit:** This is the maximum favor you can obtain in a day for all gods. Once you reach it, you will no longer be awarded favor with any god.

4. **Godly Bonus Rank 1:** This is how you get bonuses from the Gods by praying to them in 3 Ranks. Each rank gives a different bonus and has a different cooldown.

5. **Godly Bonus Rank 2**

6. **Godly Bonus Rank 3**

## Mars

### Godly Bonus Rank 1

![Mars godly rank 1](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/Mars_godly_rank_1.png "Mars godly rank 1")

This will increase with level. Certain [costumes](/costumes "costumes") can lower the cooldown.

### Godly Bonus Rank 2

![Mars godly rank 2](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/Mars_godly_rank_2.png "Mars godly rank 2")

Provides a holy oil that increases your agility for 3 days. However, if you are at max agility it will not work, so it's not very useful. Certain [costumes](/costumes "costumes") can lower the cooldown.

Check more info on Holy Oils [here](/items/misc "Holy Oils").

### Godly Bonus Rank 3

![Mars godly rank 3](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/Mars_godly_rank_3.png "Mars godly rank 3")

Prevents all critical hits in your battles in all fights in arenas, dungeons, turma, and expeditions. This is useful when you are facing an enemy that has a lot more critical strike than you and you regularly lose because of critical hits on you. It is useful in special occasions. Certain [costumes](/costumes "costumes") can lower the cooldown.

## Mercury

### Godly Bonus Rank 1

![Mercury godly rank 1](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/Mercury_godly_rank_1.png "Mercury godly rank 1")

Increases with level. Certain [costumes](/costumes "costumes") can lower the cooldown.

### Godly Bonus Rank 2

![Mercury godly rank 2](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/Mercury_godly_rank_2.png "Mercury godly rank 2")

Provides a holy oil that increases your intelligence for 3 days. However, if you are at max intelligence it will not work, so it's not very useful. Certain [costumes](/costumes "costumes") can lower the cooldown.

Check more info on Holy Oils [here](/items/misc "Holy Oils").

### Godly Bonus Rank 3

![Mercury godly rank 3](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/Mercury_godly_rank_3.png "Mercury godly rank 3")

Reduces the healing powers of your enemies. Mostly usable in Circus Turma or Dungeons. Analyze the Battle reports on your lost Circus/Dungeon battles and if you notice that the enemy is receiving a lot of healing from a good healer, this can increase your odds of winning. Perhaps a good fight for rank 1 and the rank 1 pot would be a good example to use this godly bonus. Perhaps not very useful in general.

## Diana

### Godly Bonus Rank 1

![Diana bonus rank 1](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/Diana_godly_rank_1.png "Diana bonus rank 1")

Provides a holy oil that increases your dexterity for 3 days. However, if you are at max dexterity it will not work, so it's not very useful. Certain [costumes](/costumes "costumes") can lower the cooldown.

Check more info on Holy Oils [here](/items/misc "Holy Oils").

### Godly Bonus Rank 3

![Diana bonus rank 3](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/Diana_godly_rank_3.png "Diana bonus rank 3")

Really powerful bonus. If you are struggling on a dungeon boss or a strong opponent in Circus Turma, this will really give you odds of winning. Sadly it only lasts 2 hours.

### Godly Bonus Rank 2

![Apollo bonus rank 2](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/Apollo_godly_rank_2.png "Apollo bonus rank 2")

This is the most powerful of all gods blessings and is the only oil that will always work, regardless of stats. The damage it provides increases with level and lasts for 3 days. Certain [costumes](/costumes "costumes") can lower the cooldown and increase the length of the oil.

Check more info on Holy Oils [here](/items/misc "Holy Oils").

### Godly Bonus Rank 3

![Apollo godly rank 3](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/Apollo_godly_rank_3.png "Apollo godly rank 3")

Check more info on Holy Oils [here](/items/misc "Holy Oils").

### Godly Bonus Rank 3

![Minerva godly rank 3](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/Minerva_godly_rank_3.png "Minerva godly rank 3")

Prevents all double hits in all battles in dungeons, arenas, turma, and expeditions. If you are facing an enemy that double hits you a lot, use it and you might get better odds at winning. Overall, not very useful bonus.
