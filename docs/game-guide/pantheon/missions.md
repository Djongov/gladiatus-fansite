Missions are one-time achievements that your character can achieve and be rewarded. Rewards are in the form of God favors: ![Mars favor](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/mars_favor.png "Mars favor") ![Diana favor](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/diana_favor.png "Diana favor") ![Apollo favor](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/apollo_favor.png "Apollo favor") ![Mercury favor](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/merkur_favor.png "Mercury favor") ![Minerva favor](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/minerva_favor.png "Minerva favor") ![Vulcanus favor](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Gods/vulcanus_favor.png "Vulcanus favor").

Once you complete a certain mission, it will pop up on the screen and the mission will be ready to be completed with the button ![Finish](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/button_finish.jpg "Finish"). You can choose to complete them at any time you want, but keep in mind that **completing the missions will increase your total (max) favor with the gods**! Yes, not only do they give you favor, they also raise your max, so you should be completing the missions right away!
