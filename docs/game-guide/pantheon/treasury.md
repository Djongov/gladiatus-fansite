Treasury tab is the home of the Chest of Divine Fate.

In each of these chests, there are 12 possible treasures of 3 different quality levels. Gold are the rarest, silver are uncommon, and the bronze ones appear the most. But only upon opening the chest will you find out which divinely fated treasure you have received.

## How It Works

The Chest of Divine Fate has possible winnings that randomly spawn every time after you do a spin on your current chest. If you want to wait, that's no problem—the current arranged possible winnings will stay until you spin. You need a Chest of Divine Fate "item" to be able to try and get one of the rewards.

### How to Get Chest of Fate

- **Free:** Drops once a day from Arena fights like Arena or Circus Turma. One guaranteed drop per character per day.

## Reward Types

There are 3 types of rewards based on their rarity:

### Gold Border

![Gold border](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Treasury/border_gold.png "Gold border")

These are the most expensive or elite items that can spawn as possible rewards. These are the rarest to spawn and include costumes, name change tokens, gender change tokens, or large numbers of smaller quality rewards.

### Silver Border

![Silver border](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Treasury/border_silver.png "Silver border")

These are common, and every time a number of these are guaranteed to spawn as possible winnings. They include Pacts, Gates, Mobilisation, and medium amounts of smaller quality rewards.

### Normal Border

![Normal border](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Treasury/border_default.png "Normal border")

Represents common items. Most of the possible winnings will spawn as normal items.
