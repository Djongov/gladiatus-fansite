## Under Construction (75% done)

This Gladiatus Game/Beginner's guide 2018 will be targeting the newer audience but is also suitable for refreshing the knowledge on older players for some of the basic aspects of the game. The game is about you (the player) being a gladiator fighting in different countries, going on expeditions, dungeons, arenas, events and the underworld. You can train stats, find gear and improve yourself.

---

## Creating a character

The first thing you need to do to start playing Gladiatus is to create a character on a server. Gladiatus has dedicated servers in 30 different countries:

[lobby.gladiatus.gameforge.com](https://lobby.gladiatus.gameforge.com)
Once you choose your country this is where you can register for an account:

![Register an account](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/register.png "Register an account")

Every country has a number of different servers (Provinces) with different speeds. Most of the servers are running on normal speed but some of the servers are running on higher speeds meaning that leveling and the pace of game is X amount of times quicker than the normal pace of the game

![Provinces](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/provinces.png "Provinces")

Once you click Sign Up your journey begins right away

\*If you want to know what a Speed Server is - Go to [Speed Server](#Speed_Server "Speed Server") section of this page

You are greeted with this message

![Greeting](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/greeting.png "Greeting")

Choose a gender. Yes, choose wisely because you can change it later but definitely not right away or anytime soon.

## Overview Screen

You will be placed in the Overview screen where you can see your character, stats, inventory, bags and everything else

![Overview screen](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Overview_screen.png "Overview screen")

We are going to look at all these individually

The next thing you want to do is verify your email so you can enjoy full featured game. Ever since you clicked Sign Up, an email with an activation link has been sent to your registration email address.

---

## Statistics

The tab next to the Overview screen is the Statistics tab. It shows general info for your character. It's pretty self-explanatory so it doesn't need any real clarification. Just for someone who is wondering about the people mugged (via link) it was an old feature of the game that is no longer in the game but remains on the statistics tab. Also the dungeon drop down menu can show you stats of your dungeon journeys

![Statistics](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Statistics.png "Statistics")

---

## Victories

Victories in Gladiatus are what we call Achievements in other games. They mostly award titles that your character can have. There are several categories of achievements for different accomplishments in the game. These are the main categories of achievements:

![Victories](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Victories.png "Victories")

Every Victory (achievement) provides Victory points so this measures your total. Different Victories provide different Victory points. From 0 to 30.

Click in-game to check them for more info.

---

## Familia

Familia is the tab where your friend list resides. When you add someone as your friend it will appear here along with his name, guild and last online status.

![Familia](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Familia.png "Familia")

But how do you befriend someone? It's not from the Familia tab. It's from the character screen. When you look at the other player's character profile there will be a "Invite to your familia" button

![Add friend](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Familia_add_friend.png "Add friend")

---

## Pantheon

The Pantheon is a fundamental system in Gladiatus consisting of 4 submenus: Quests, Missions, Gods, and Treasury. These systems allow you to earn rewards, gain god favors, and access premium items.

**[Read the complete Pantheon Guide →](/game-guide/pantheon)**

---

## Guild

Guild is one of the most important aspects of the game. Joining a guild gives you social interaction, reduces cost for training, provides centralized guild storage, guild market, guild chat and you can heal your character in the Guild Medic. Being such a big topic, there will be a Guilds page on this website as a separate big article.

---

## Highscore

The Highscore tab leads to several sub-tabs where you can check different rankings on this particular province or server.

**Player**

By default the general ranking in Gladiatus refers to the "Player" rank and players in the "Player" ranking are scored and sorted based on their Honour points.

![Player ranking](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Player_ranking.png "Player ranking")

The ranking also measures other player stats such as the Level, Honour, Fame, Wins, Victories and Gold

![Ranking header](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Ranking_header.png "Ranking header")

Note - Players represented in **Green** color are players who are in the same guild as you - guildmates and players in **Orange** are players that you are friends with (Familia)

Level - Player's level. If clicked it will sort ranking by player's level

Honour - this is the default ranking

Fame - If clicked it will sort ranking by player's fame

Wins - this is the overall summary of arena + circus Turma wins. Basically what you see on the Statistics screen

Victories - The total Victory points accumulated through your achievements. Every Victory (achievement) provides Victory points so this measures your total. Some Victories provide 10 points, some 5 and some 3

Gold - Just like Wins, this is your total stolen/capture gold from your enemies. Summary of arena + circus Turma

There is a button just below the "Player highscore"

![7 day highscores](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/7-day-highscore.png "7 day highscores")

Clicking will show you the Highscore rankings as they are but for the last 7 days. This is a good check who is active on the server.

**Dungeons**

The default Dungeon highscore is for All-time Highscore and rankings are individual for every dungeon and represent a ranking of players by Max. Fame. Max. Fame represents the total fame acquired from 1 run. Other stats measured here are:

Finished - Number of times a dungeon has been completed by 1 players

Damage & Healing - These are not very well understood yet. It shows max and average numbers

Same as Player highscore, the dungeon highscore has a 7 day variant. It all seems not really relevant.

However, there is one very interesting dungeon ranking - (Dungeon - Boss Items)

![Dungeon items ranking](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/dungeon-ranking-items.png "Dungeon items ranking")

Here you can see the last 20 items that have dropped from any dungeon in the game, regardless of your level. Yes, you can be level 1 and you can observe the last 20 items that have dropped in Alpha & Omega, the last dungeon in the game (Level 120+)

![Alpha & Omega drops](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Alpha_Omega_drops.png "Alpha & Omega drops")

**Guilds highscore**

The guilds highscore tab shows the server guild ranking. Just like Player ranking, guild ranking is based on Honour. The total amount of Honour from all players in a guild.

![Guild Ranking explained](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/guild_ranking_header.png "Guild Ranking explained")

1\. Total Gold that the guild holds in the Bank vault

2\. Number of players in the guild

3\. Total Honour of all Players in the guild (this is how guilds are ranked)

4\. Average Honour per player. (Total Honour/Number of players in the guild)

5\. Total Fame of all Players in the guild

6\. Average Fame per player. (Total Fame/Number of players in the guild)

**Search**

The search tab lets you search for a Player, a Guild name or a Guild Tag

---

## Recruiting

The Recruiting tab is where you can invite new players to join Gladiatus and start playing on this server. If they are invited through the Recruiting system, they will be connected to you and bring you some rewards.

Every time your recruit does any of these actions, you will receive ![Recruiting points](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/icon_recruiting_points.png "Recruiting points"):

![Recruiting](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Recruiting.png "Recruiting")

![Recruiting](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Recruiting_1.png "Recruiting")

![Recruiting](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Recruiting_2.png "Recruiting")

![Recruiting](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Recruiting_3.png "Recruiting")

![Recruiting](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Recruiting_5.png "Recruiting")

And the rewards where you can spend your earned ![Recruiting points](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/icon_recruiting_points.png "Recruiting points") are:

![Recruiting rewards](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Recruiting_Rewards.png "Recruiting rewards")

## Premium

The Premium system includes Rubies (premium currency), Centurion subscription, and Pacts. These features provide powerful bonuses and convenience options for players who want to enhance their gameplay experience.

**[Read the complete Premium Guide →](/game-guide/premium)**

---

## Inventory
-------------------------------

What is special about Gladiatus is that you have an inventory and bags and you can move items inside the inventory and between bags or sell them to vendors by dragging them with your mouse. Also you can equip items by dragging them to the appropriate slot. Here is how:

You have a number of bags each with **40 slots**. 2 are available at start, 3rd unlocks at **level 10** and the 4th unlocks are **level 20**. The rest of the bags are paid, with 1x ![Magical bag](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Premium/Magical_Bag_small.png "Magical bag") or 7x ![Rubies](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_rubies.gif "Rubies") for a period of 7 days. Bag VII and VIII are twice more expensive - 14x ![Rubies](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_rubies.gif "Rubies") for 7 days or 2x ![Magical bag](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Premium/Magical_Bag_small.png "Magical bag") respectively.

These are your bags and how yo can switch between them:

![Bags](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Switching_between_bags.gif "Bags")

This is how you can move items between bags:

![Moving an item between bags](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/moving_item_between_bags.gif "Moving an item between bags")

## Items

In MMO games like Gladiatus, gearing up is the goal of the game. Items in Gladiatus are very similar to World of Warcraft's items. When you hover an item with the mouse you can see its stats and items come in different qualities. You can also drag the items

This is how to move an item in your inventory:

![Moving an item](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Moving_item.gif "Moving an item")

This is how you can equip an item:

![Equip an item](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Equping_item.gif "Equip an item")

Now a little bit about Items in general. More and extensive info on the [Items](/items "Items") page but we will cover basics here. Items can occupy from 1 to 6 slots in your inventory so you need to manage it correctly and efficiently to hold as much item as possible.

An item is formed by a base item + Prefix word + Suffix word. The item level of an item is also formed from the level of the base item + the level of the Prefix + the level of the Suffix. More about [Prefixes](/items/prefixes "Prefixes") and [Suffixes](/items/suffixes "Suffixes").

### Item Drops

Items, similar to World of Warcraft come in several come in several colors of quality

Standard (**White**) - Represents the base item. At lowest levels 1-10 **White** can drop from expeditions in Grim Wood but they stop dropping beyond it

Ceres (**Green**) - This is the base quality level of any item that has at least one Prefix or Suffix or both. (on low levels there could be items with no prefix or suffix that are **Green** or higher quality and have one stats on it)

Neptune (**Blue**) - This is an upgrade quality over Green. Every stats on the item is increased by 13%

Mars (**Purple**) - This is an upgrade quality over Blue. Stats are 15% better than **Blue**.

Jupiter (**Orange**) - It's very rare for an item to roll an **Orange** quality and these items represent one of the best items in the game. That's are 17% increased over the **Purple**

Olympus (**Red**) - Until 2015 the **Red** item quality only existed in the game code but had never dropped. With the implementation of the Forge in 2015 the **Red** items came into existence but are so rare that apart from Forging the % drop chance is so low that has not been recorded. Stats are almost twice as better than **Green** and 15% better than **Orange**.

How rare is each quality?

    **Average**   **Green** 68.58%   **Blue** 27.40%   **Purple** 3.30%   **Orange** 0.70%   **Red** 0.01%   In one word - **Purple**, **Orange** and **Red** are extremely low with Red being unimaginably low

**Purple** you can expect to see from the very beginning but very very rarely. The drop % chance increases to a more suitable level from [Dark Catacombs](/dungeons/germania-dungeons "Dark Catacombs").

**Orange** very rarely in the mid levels 30-40+ and considerably but more often but still very rarely after 102 level

**Red** is so rare that you wouldn't expect one to drop for months or sometimes a year. Best way to obtain such an item is [Forging](/forging/general "Forging")

**Primary and Secondary drops**

In Gladiatus there is a primary and a secondary drop. The Primary drops are your regular drops from a mob like items and secondary drops are items such as Forging goods and Scrolls.

![Primary and Secondary drops](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/primary_secondary_drops.png "Primary and Secondary drops")

You can have a Primary and a Secondary drop simultaneously, in 1 kill as shown above.

Secondary drops even work when you lose the battle!

![Secondary drop when you loose](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/secondary_drops_lose.png "Secondary drop when you loose")

**Soul bound** - Equipping an item makes it Soulbound to your character. This means that if you trade it over to someone else, he will not be able to equip it. You can remove the Soulbound status of an item with an item called Mirror which is a premium item and we will talk more about it in Alchemist vendor section.

![Soul bound](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/soulbound_1.png "Soul bound")

![Soul bound](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/soulbound_warning.png "Soul bound")

### Scrolls and Recipies

Forging recipes are learned through scrolls. Scrolls can drop from mobs in expeditions and dungeons or through Smelting. There are different color variations of the scrolls but they seem really random and not important or tied in any way to the actual recipe. You can see all type of scrolls and how they look here - [Scrolls](/items#Scrolls "Scrolls").

Here is an example how Lucius Scroll drops from Dragon, the boss in [Koman Mountain](/expeditions/germania-expeditions/koman-mountain "Koman Mountain").

![Lucius scroll drop](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Lucius_scroll_drop.png "Lucius scroll drop")

Here is an example how a scroll with a prefix or suffix can drop from [Smelting](/forging/smelting "Smelting") too. However the drop chance is low - about 5%.

![Scroll from Smelting](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Smelting/smelt_scroll.png "Scroll from Smelting")

Scrolls however, on their own, are nothing special. They are just recipes of Prefixes/Suffixes that you can learn by dragging them onto your character profile picture. Once learned they will be available in the Forge and you can start making items with that Prefix/Suffix. If you want to know more about what Prefixes and Suffixes or Items in general are out there go to the [Items](/items "Items") page.

Here are some facts about Scrolls:

1. Scrolls drop from mobs around the world
2. Scrolls can be produced by Smelting an item. At low (~5%) chance every smelt can produce a scroll with the prefix or suffix of the smelted item
3. Scrolls are not soul bound and can be sold in the Market
4. Scrolls have item levels. A lot of things are dependent on the item level. For example a scroll of 94 item level cannot drop for you before your character is 94 level
5. One Prefix/Suffix can be learned only once. If a Scroll drops for a second time and you already have this prefix or suffix, you won't be able to learn the scroll again
6. Scrolls sell for a lot of ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold") in the vendors. If you don't immediately need need it or if you already have it, you can sell it for gold in the vendor or use it for gold saving from attacks maneuver (sell it, train a skill point, when you gather the money to buy the scroll, simply buy it so you don't hold a lot of gold with you)
7. Also how much ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold") a Scroll is worth is random between a range. For example, Lucius Scroll can sometimes be 250.625 ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold") but for someone else it can drop and sell for 222.216 ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold"). It's random amount in a fixed range.
8. Every prefix/suffix adds levels to the item when applied. This is the Scroll item level -10. Example: of Fatuity suffix Scroll is 46 item level. This means that the suffix will add 36 item levels to the item to which is applied. More info on the [Items](/items "Items") page.

**Wearing Item levels and visibility**

Gladiatus is very specific in terms of how and when you can wear your items. The game in general tries and will let you see and drop items with item levels that you can wear. However, it is reasonable to have a limit to what you can wear. This limit is +16 levels above your character level. This means that if you are level 94, you can only wear items up to level 110 (94+16=110). Item that is more than 16 levels above your character will have its item level in Red, just like in the example below:

This is how a level 94 sees item level 111

![High level item](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/high_level_item.png "High level item")

However, the game doesn't really restrict your in equipping a higher level item. It just tries to restrict the ways of obtaining one.

So what happens when you try to equip such an item?

- If you equip it on your main character - when you fight in Expeditions, it will be all fine. Item will be there and it will be functional. However, in Arena and Arena Provincarum it won't count. It will be just as you have no item in this slot. This is a way of protecting the competitive part of the game from overfeeding a character and for him to dominate other players with unfair item level items
- If you equip it on your dungeon character - It's all fine. The item will be working and be just like any other in both Dungeons and Circus Turma/Cirucs Provincarum
 
So it turns out that the game actually allows you to wear any item out there it will just try to restrict you into obtaining a higher item level in the first place. So how is the game doing that:

- In the Auction House, you can only see items that are +14 levels above your character. That's even lower than what you can "legally" equip. With "Seal of Praetor" [Seal Pact](#Seal_Pacts "Seal Pact") you can increase this by 2, eventually seeing up to +16 levels above your character, matching the general rule of your character wearing +16
- In Market you can only see items that are +9 levels above your character. With Seal of Praetor that goes up to +11 so you can't get a higher item level from the Market and from other players
- In Guild Market and Guild Warehouse, same rules applies as in Market - +9/+11, so essentially a guild mate cannot transfer you a higher item level just to boost you
- Expedition enemy will never drop an item that is more than +16 item levels above your character. Even if this particular expedition enemy can drop a higher item level, it will not drop you such a high item level until you level up and cover the +16 rule. This is a very interesting expedition property.
- Dungeon minions will never drop an item that you can't wear too
 
So you can see that the game design restricts you from obtaining a higher than +16 item level item. There are however few exceptions and there is a possibility of obtaining a higher item level item but it's so hard and unreasonable that it's not really an issue:

- Dungeon bosses item level drop range is so wide that most of the times if you defeat a dungeon boss immediately on entry level, if he rolls to drop you an item of his higher item level range, it will be red for you and unwearable. But this isn't really considered unfair because this is usually just a few levels in difference. Here is an example:
 
Poisoned Country dungeon. Entry level 35. Character is 35 well equipped and can defeat the boss immediately. The boss item level drop range is 45-54. On Level 35, everything above item level 51 will be in red and unwearable. Here is a direct example with a [screenshot](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Dungeons/example_of_high_level_drop_dungeon.png "screenshot"). So this seems like an example for exception where the game allows for higher item level drops to drop but it doesn't seem like a big issue because it's only few levels above which is not really that bad.

- Another way of obtaining a higher level item is Forging. The game has a built-in protection that will discourage you from trying to forge items that are more than +16 levels above your character by lowering the forge success chance significantly. This is how it goes:
 
Forging an item that is exactly +16 item levels above your character, on the limit - the default success chance is 45%

+17 = 43%

+18 = 39%

+19 = 34%

+20 = 27%

+21 = 21%

+22 = 15%

+23 = 12%

+24 = 9%

+25 = 8%

+26 = 6%

+27 = 5%

+28 = 4%

and so on...

You can see that with some luck and using costumes or Micro events that boost forging success chance, it is possible to forge a higher level item but it's so risky and so unreasonable that it's just not worth it. That's why the game allows for these 2 ways of obtaining a higher than +16 level items but they are left in there just because they are not such a big issue and blend in the game just fine.

## Packages

Whenever you collect and item, through defeating a mob, repairing or forging an item or buying an item from the Auction House, it will not directly come into your inventory. Instead, it will be sent to your character as a package. The package interface can be found on the top left screen of your game interface with this icon:

![Packages](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/packages.png "Packages") or ![Unread Packages](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/packages_active.png "Unread Packages") if you have "unread" packages

When you click it you will go to the Packages interface

![Package interface](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/package_interface.png "Package interface")

so when an item is sent to your character as a package, it will stay there for 7 days (more if you use certain costumes). If you want to use it or just store it in your inventory bags, you can drag it out of the packaging interface.

As packages can grow large in 7 days, the package interface allows for sorting and searching of your items in your package interface. You can search by name, search by type (Armour or gloves or a recipe) and you can set a minimum quality to be shown. For example, if you are looking for these orange materials and you want only orange materials to be shown so you can drag them to your inventory but you don't want any other quality, you can set type of object to Forging goods, then set the minimum quality to Orange and show only orange materials.

Package system is often used as additional storage because the bag slots and inventory are just not enough to hold all of your items that you find on your adventures. Just be aware that when a package expires it will "sell" the item for the amount it costs to a vendor in ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold") and the will deposit the gold directly to your active gold on the character. This may sound good, at least the item is not deleted, at least you will get the gold worth of and this is indeed very generous but there is a danger of piling up too much gold and be easy prey to attackers. Best to spend the gold as soon as the package expires or just do not let the items expire and sell them to vendors at your convenience.

![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold")Gold is represented with the icon ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold") and is the most essential part of the game.

You can obtain gold in the following ways:

- By fighting in Expeditions
- By fighting in Dungeons
- By fighting in the Arenas
- By fighting in the Underworld
- By participating in Events
- By Working
- By selling items in Vendors/Market
- By activating Centurio or Centurio related foods
 
Gold is used for:

- Training stats of your character
- Purchasing items from vendors/market/auction house
- Forging/smelting/repairing of items
- Traveling between countries
- Upgrading items in Magus Hermeticus
- Build Guild buildings by donating gold to the Guild Bank

## Leveling

You level up when you reach the experience points required for the next level. So this is what happens when you level up:

![Level Up](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Level_up.png "Level Up")

- You will receive ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold"). The amount is higher as the levels go up
- Cooldown for quests will be reset
- Your character will be healed to max HP
- Expedition and Dungeons points will be refilled to max
- Your max trainable stats (Str, Dex, Agi...) will increase. Formula is (trained stat\*1.5)+Char Level
 
Let's talk about leveling itself. As any game the higher the level, the higher it is to level up. However, in Gladiatus after level 84, the experience required to level up increases exponentially (almost). After level 100, you could expect 1 level to take almost a month (this really depends on play style and Underworld costumes usage)

The formulas for the required experience to level up is

**From level 1-52**

(10\*(level+1)-5)-10

**From level 53-79**

(10\*(level+0.5))-10

**From level 80** - Unknown

If you want to level up quick, you could use a mix of [Blessing pacts](#Blessing "Blessing pacts") and utilize your expeditions to the max, meaning that you should not fight enemies that you lose against. Also after level 100, it is really important which UW (Underworld) costume you use. The best one for leveling is Dis Pater Normal costume. You should also play on events, they are almost always involving an extra expedition which you can fight and in and gain experience. You could also play with Cervisia and other 1 day Centurio items and use them only when below 12 expedition and dungeon points so they can effectively refresh extra points. Also, good advice is not to stay on full points for a long period of time as these are wasted points.

When you start the game not all features are available right away. Some of them unlock as you level up

- Market - Unlocks at Level
- Auction House - Unlocks at Level
- Vendors - Unlock at Level
- Dungeons and Circus Turma - Unlock at Level 10
- Underworld - Unlocks at Level 100

## Character Stats

Character stats is a huge topic and this article will be highly scientific getting to every detail for every stat out there

### Non-Combat Stats

A character in Gladiatus has a lot of stats. Here are some of the non-combat character statistics you can gather from your journeys in the game:

![Honour](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_honor_small.gif "Honour") **Honour** - Honour is obtained by winning fights in Expeditions and Arenas (not Circus) with Expeditions granting the most. Honour does not give any direct benefits but player's rank in a server (province) is determined by Honour standing

![Experience](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_level_small.gif "Experience") **Experience** - Participating in a fight, whether it is in Expedition, Dungeon or Arena fights grants experience. You need a certain amount of experience to level up. You can get 1-2 experience even if you lose a fight.

![Level](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_level.gif "Level") **Level -** You level up when you reach the experience points required for the next level. Read more about it in the [Leveling](#Leveling "Leveling") section.

**![Fame](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/icon_fame.gif "Fame") Fame** - Fame is just like Honour, which is shown in player rankings. Fame is generated in Dungeons and Circus Turma wins only and comes in a lot lower numbers than Honour

### Character Statistics

There are 6 character stats in Gladiatus. Strength, Dexterity, Agility, Constitution, Charisma and Intelligence. Players start with 5 points of each. These stats are trained with ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold") only. There are couple of ways to get discounts on how much gold stats cost. By being in a guild and level of Training Grounds in the guild, costumes, Micro events. Here is a link to the calculator page where you can play with costs - [https://gladiatus.gamerz-bg.com/?id=62.](?id=62) In-game, if you hover your mouse on the below stats you can see explanations as well

![Stats](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/start_stats.png "Stats")

**Strength** - Increases damage of your character and chance to block

10 Strength = 1 Damage

10% of Strength \[round down\] = Block value

**Dexterity** - Increases % hit chance of your character and chance of you doing a double hit or a critical hit

10% of Dexterity \[round down\] = Critical attack value

For % hit chance and double hit, read further below

**Agility** - Decreases the % hit chance of your opponent and the chance that they will double hit or critical hit you

10% of Agility \[round down\] = Resilience/hardening value

**Constitution** - Increases life points (Health points) and regeneration of life points

Max Health points = Health points from level + Health points through constitution + Health points from items + Health points from reinforcements

Health points from level = Character Level \*25

Health points through constitution = (Constitution\*2)-50

Base Health points Regeneration (per Hour) = Through Level + Through Constitution

Through Level = Character Level \*2

Through Constitution = Constitution \*2

Every other buff to Health points regeneration is on top of the Base Health points regeneration

Example. from guild, buffs, blessings, costumes

**Charisma** - Increases the chance for a double hit, also increases Threat in dungeons

for double hit values look read further below

**Intelligence** - Increases chance of learning against expedition opponents, Increases healing in dungeon battles and the chance of critical healing, Increases healing from food, Reduces opponent's chance of a double hit

There is a cap on how much of these stats you can have. The formula is:

**Maximum of a stat (Strength, Dexterity, A...)** = Basic trained stat + (basic / 2) + Character Level

Example:

Character Level = 115

Basic Strength (through training) = 226

Formula = 226 + (226/2) + 115 = 226 + 113 + 115 = 454

Strength through items or dusts or holy oils cannot go higher than the max. Buffs that can increase the max stat temporary are pacts, Godly rank 1 buffs and reinforcements (excluding dusts)

![Max stat explained](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/max_stat.png "Max stat explained")

**Maximum stats through training =** Character Level \*5 (from Level 1-40 the cap is 200)

Example: Character Level = 115. 115\*5 = 575

![Max train stat explained](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/max_stat_2.png "Max train stat explained")

**Health points**

Another really important stat is health points. We already mentioned that Health points are closely related to Constitution stat and your character level. When you receive damage, your health drops with the amount of damage you have received. In Gladiatus you can heal yourself by eating food. More you can read more about it on the [Food](/items#Food "Food") page. There are other ways to heal yourself, like using the Guild Medic, regenerate health over time just by waiting or using a 100% healing potion.

### Combat Statistics

Combat stats are directly linked to main character stats above

**Armour** - Armour is gained through wearing items. All items can grant Armour, even Weapons and Jewellery. Armour absorbs damage - If your opponent does 350 damage and your armour absorption is 150 damage, he will hit you for 200. Armor works always (except for when it's removed by a Godly blessing)

Minimal armour absorption = (Armour/74)-(Armour/74)/660+1 \[round up\]  
 If result is negative then it is 0

Maximal armour absorption = (Armour/66)+(Armour/660) \[round down\]

In the end the Armour absorption looks like this

![Absorb example](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/absorb_example.png "Absorb example")

**Resilience/hardening value** - Strength and Items can grant you hardening value. Resilience and hardening value seem to be the same thing. Resilience value increases your character's chance of avoiding critical hits from your opponents. Works together with Agility stat to reduce critical hits on your. However, the maximum reduction is 25%

Chance to avoid critical hits = (Resilience \* 52 / (Character Level-8 )) / 4

Your maximum cap for amassing hardening value is = FLOOR.MATH(24.5\*4\*(Character Level-8)/52)+1 . Anything above this rating will just be waste as the cap is 25%

**Blocking value**- Successful block reduces the damage inflicted on you by 50%. Have in mind that Damage and absorption from Armour both varies with minimum and maximum damage dealt or absorbed so often the blocked attack (damage reduced in half) can be so low that it can be completely absorbed by Armour, dealing 0 damage in total . Blocking % comes from your Blocking value from Strength and Items. Maximum blocking chance is 50%

Total Blocking value = (Strength/10) \[round down\] + Block value from items

Chance to block a hit = (Blocking value \* 52 / (Character Level-8 )) / 6

Your maximum cap for amassing Blocking value is = FLOOR.MATH(49.5\*6\*(Character Level-8)/52)+1

**Damage** - Damage is how much health points you can reduce from your opponent with a single hit. Damage is formed from your weapon damage + Damage from Strength + Damage from items

Minimal damage = Minimal damage of weapon + damage through items + (Strength / 10)

Maximal damage = Maximal damage of weapon + damage through items + (Strength / 10)

**Chance to hit** - This is the chance of your character to hit your opponent at all. It depends on your Dexterity and your opponent's Agility. Formula is:

Your Dexterity/(Your Dexterity + Enemies Agility) x 100 \[round down\]

**Double hit** - Chance to make 2 hits in 1 round of attack. Depends on your Charisma and Dexterity and your opponent's Agility and Intelligence

Chance for double hit = Your Charisma \* Your Dexterity / Enemy Intelligence / Enemy Agility \* 10

**Critical hit** - Chance to do 2x damage on your attack. This counts for every attack. You can double hit and the 2 hits you make in 1 round can be critical strikes. Maximum of 50% critical hit chance is allowed (60% with Pact). Your % to land a critical hit depends on your critical attack value from Dexterity and through items.

Total Critical attack value = (Dexterity/10) \[round down\] + Critical attack value from items

Chance for critical hit = (Critical attack value \* 52 / (Character Level-8 )) / 5

Your maximum cap for amassing Critical hit value = FLOOR.MATH(49.5\*5\*(Character Level-8)/52)+1

**Healing** - In Dungeons and Circus Turma, one of the NPCs can heal. Healing is essentially returning some life points to a damaged character. Healing is increased by items and Intellect. Healing has also some properties:

**Normal Healing** - How much a character can heal is calculated with the following formula: 4/5\* intelligence \[round down\] + healing from objects

**Critical Healing** is % chance for healing twice as much (Normal Healing\*2). Critical healing % chance depends on Critical healing value. It comes from Intelligence and Healing

Total Critical healing value **=** (Intelligence/5) \[round down\] + Critical healing value from items

Your maximum cap for amassing Critical healing value = FLOOR.MATH(89.5\*7\*(Character Level-8)/52)+1

Chance for Critical healing = (Critical healing \* 52 / (level-8 ) / 8

## Fighting in Gladiatus

Battles in Gladiatus are based on rounds. When the fight begins, Round 1 starts. In each round, Attacker and Defender are exchanging attacks. The first to attack is always the Defender. The winner is determined by whoever does the most damage in a certain number of rounds or whoever dies (reaches 0 Health points) first.

**Expeditions** - Until death or whoever takes more damage in 20 rounds

**Arena** - Until death or whoever makes more damage in 15 rounds

**Dungeons** - Until death with no limit on rounds but the more rounds pass the stronger the dungeon mob becomes (particularly in damage)

**Circus Turma** - Until death or whoever makes more damage in 50 rounds

Every round is also based on [RNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation "Randomness"). Because most of the combat stats are maxed at 50% cap and because chance to hit rarely surpasses 60% the randomness of who hits who successfully in a fight or who lands a critical hit is very big. Therefore it is possible to beat a stronger opponent with "lucky" hits. Of course this cannot happen when the difference in powerful two gladiators are is too vast but on close stats the "luck" can really make a difference.

The fights can be examined in the Battle Reports in details

## Speed Server

Speed server is a special server in which the game runs at faster pace. The speed servers were implemented by Gameforge so that new players can catch up quicker and not be discouraged by the huge time required to level up on the high levels. You can recognize if the server is a speed server by opening the drop-down menu in the Register form:

![Speed Servers](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Speed_Servers.png "Speed Servers")

Servers can be in different speeds from x2 up to x5. So what exactly is "quicker" in these servers. Let's answer it. How shorter is the below is entirely dependent on how many times the server is speeded (x5 or x4 etc.):

- Shorter Expedition, Dungeon, Underworld, Arena and Circus Turma cooldowns
- Quicker regeneration of Expedition and dungeon points
- Shorter quest cooldown and shorter time on time limit quests
- Shorter travel time in the Hermit
- Shorter cooldowns in vendors
- Quicker Auction House cycle
- Shorter Forging cooldowns
- Increased max daily favor with gods
- Quicker cooldowns on Godly Ranks 1, 2 and 3
- Shorter buff duration on oils and reinforcements
- You work quicker. 8 hour stable boy on speed 4 = 2 hours of actual work

## Tips & Tricks

Here are some tips and tricks that probably won't be known by the new gladiator

### Re-Packaging

If you have a package that is about to expire but you are not ready to be sold for gold or you want to be packaged again, you can re-package it for another 7 days by dragging it to your inventory and re-cycle it through one of the game systems and be sent over as a package. Few suggestions:

1\. Place on guild/normal Market for 1g and immediately cancel the trade. The item will then be send back as a package and this will only cost you 1g

2\. Start repairing the item (won't work if 100% conditioned) but cancel it right away. This way you will only pay for the fee to put the item. When cancelled the item will be sent back as a package

### Gold-Saving Techniques

The art of being a successful and good Gladiator is to spend your gold wisely. The only good reasons to spend gold is to train stats and to purchase items from the Auction house or spend gold on buffs. This means that you don't want to be spending gold for unnecessary items, hugely overpriced items in the Auction house, items that you don't really need and can't get value out of them after and last but not least - lose as little gold as you can from Arena attacks. We know that the more gold you hold in your character, the more an Arena attacker will plunder from you. This means that at any time you should be minimizing the gold that you hold in your character. However, this is easier said than done. We said earlier that we shouldn't be spending gold on useless items, or items that cost more to buy then to sell in a vendor later. You might not have enough gold to train a stat in the Training ground and the gold needed for training the stat can be so far away that holding this much gold until you are ready to train can be really reckless and risky. So here are few suggestions on how to rotate gold in and out so you save it for later, while maintaining none or very little gold on your character, being safe from attacks.

**Selling Amulets and Scrolls** - Amulets and Scrolls are the two most expensive types of items in Gladiatus. You can use them to your benefit. Save in your inventory bags amulets and forging scrolls that you don't need to use right away. When you amass a certain number of amulets or scrolls, sell some of them (or all) to the vendor, enough to train stat of your choice in the Training grounds. Now you've spent your gold and have the amulets/scrolls in the vendor. You will continue fighting in expeditions, dungeons and arenas and as you win enough gold to buy an amulet, go to the vendor and buy it back. That's how you've spend your gold immediately. Do it again for the rest of the amulets/scrolls in the vendor. When you buy them all back, repeat it all over again. Sell them, train a stat, start buying them one by one so you can stay low on gold and repeat and repeat. The higher the quality of the amulets, the more they cost. Best to use Blue, Purple and Orange ones. This is the most common form of gold-saving. It becomes harder when you need millions of gold to train 1 point but that's where you can increase the use of scrolls where amulets will become too low on gold value. There are no downsides to this approach. It just might be harder once you reach the stats training costs in millions and you should be on the lookout for vendor cooldowns. You don't want to forget about it and for it to reset while your amulets and scrolls are sold and you haven't bought them back yet. Happened to all of us a number of times of course, but best if you minimize it.

**Gold re-packaging** - Another way of saving gold is through repacking it. For this one however, you need to be in a guild and you need the help of a guild mate. The idea is to make the gold your character holds into a package, where it can stay in the Packaging system for at least 7 days, safe from all harm. So how does it work. You are Player 1 and the guild mate will be called Player 2. Let's say you have 1 million gold that you want to package. You will write a guild message asking "Please can someone pack 1 mil gold for me". Player 2 is online and would like to help. He will then pick one item out of his inventory and will place it in the Guild Market. Player 2 needs to be aware of the Market view limitations and not to put item that is too high level for you to see. Best if forging goods are used, they have no item level and are considered to be Level 1 when it comes to Market. So you are asking for 1 million gold. He will put the material in the Guild Market and will place a cost for it of 1 million gold. However, the Guild Market has 2% fee for placing a 2 hour sell. On 1 million gold this is 20000 in fee. Why should he pay for it, when is the one doing you a favor, he could ask, and he would be right. Different guilds have different rules. Some people don't care about the fee but some might do. If you want to be on the safe side, you could just say that you want the fee to be included so you can cover the cost of the Player 2 doing the repacking for you. You just might want to make it clear that you want the fee to be included on the first message asking for the re-pack by saying "Please can someone pack 1 mil gold + fee for me". Let's get back to Player 2 preparing the material for selling. If no fee is included, he would place the material at exactly 1 mil gold for you to buy. If fee is included, he will add it on the initial placing of the material. Instead of 1.000.000 gold he will put it for 1.020.000 gold. Once published in the Market, it's now your turn to either buy it immediately (if you have the gold ready) or start amassing the gold by selling items and stuff. Once you are ready (try not to be too slow about it, as the other player is waiting for you) buy the material placed by Player 2. Now, your gold is with him and his material is with you. Take your material sold by Player 2 in your inventory and place it on the Guild Market. Place it for 1.000.000 gold. You will pay fee again. Player 2 will take the gold from the 1st purchase and buy the material you placed the 2nd time, thus you receiving 1 mil gold for it and he gets his material back. Now, you have 1 million gold packed into a package safe from attacks. The cost of doing this is: involving another player + 2x times 2% fee. in our case packaging 1 million gold, you will have to pay 40k in fees. This is the most used method for safeguarding larger amounts of gold and is the most common form of gold saving used out there. You can use both 1 and 2 suggestions at the same time. For small summs and everyday use you can use the amulets and scrolls and for larger summs you can use Gold re-packaging.

**Play like a pro** - In this section we will discuss how the pro players play the game. This is certainly not the necessary way that YOU need to play as this one involves being online very very often and have a good and supporting guild and also would investing real life money.

Now, what does it take to play like a pro? Well, we basically said it earlier. Train stats efficiently, don't waste gold to attackers and make sure your gear is good so you can profit from other players and steal their gold

- **Training stats** - if you want to train like a pro, you need to do in the most efficient way. All stats are important and should be trained with the exception of maybe Strength. Strength you can leave to natural growth through levels. It's just that Strength is not as beneficial as the other stats. 10 Strength will grant you only 1 damage and only 1 block rating. Everything else should be trained and not be ignored. Dexterity is arguably your best stat you might want to train it harder than the other. On the other hand it is expensive. Agility is also a very important stat and is cheap to train. Intelligence and Charisma are important too. You could either keep them trained the same, have them equalized or equalize them in their cost for gold or just prioritize Agility and Dexterity and train them harder and when they become unbearably expensive, turn to Charisma and Intelligence too. This doesn't mean that you should ignore them. When we say prioritize, you could do something like train 2 points of Agility and Dexterity and 1 point Charisma and Intelligence per cycle.
- **Training efficiently** - Pro players in Gladiatus always tend to train for the lowest possible cost. To be a pro and train like a pro, find a guild that has high level of Training Grounds. A Level 20 Training Grounds will reduce training costs by 40%. Do not overspend on training when there are no training cost reduction buffs. Pro players will sometime re-package gold and re-package it again until a costume event comes along where they can put on an event costume which reduces training cost with another -20%. Then they will use all the re-packed and re-packed gold all at once and train insane amounts of stats in one go.
- **Gear** - No matter how trained you are, you also need good items. Good items in lower levels will come mainly from your adventures and Auction house. However, if you are in a good guild (you will be, you are a pro) you can ask a high level character in your guild to craft a weapon or another good piece of equipment for you that will be in your usable range. Example: He can craft you a Purple/Orange or with more luck even Red Gaius weapon that you can wear on level as low as 75. Imagine how a 300 damage weapon will transform your play on level 75 or 80. On high levels, like 90 or 100+ they will need to start forging your own gear and get help with high quality orange/red materials from your guild mates so you can start forging your own good Lucius and Gaius/Antonius gear. Pro players wear Orange/Red items and are hardly beatable in their level range, especially grouped with efficient high training stats. Being good geared and godly trained means that they beat a lot of Gladiators in Arena and Cirucs. Gold that can be plundered from other players should not be underestimated. It can be millions, especially with the Hard Underworld costume.
- **Rubies** - Being a pro unfortunately, rarely comes free. You will have to have Centurio and most (all except Seal) pacts running 24/7 on you. We said that you will forge yourself the best gear out there and being Orange/Red, you won't risk precious materials on low % chance forges, so you will have to secure them with purchasing Gold forging tools. On active servers, you could even make millions and millions of gold by buying Gold forging tools and selling them on the Market to other players. A single Gold Clover can go for millions of gold
- **Maximizing stats** - It is almost impossible without being pushed by other players (which is no longer disallowed but might still be illegal if caught) to maximize your stats on low or mid levels. Certainly achievable on levels 110 + but the Gladiator must have followed the above guidelines since the character creation. The max stats cap is Character Level\*5 which means that on level 100 you can train 500 of each stat. If your character has been following the Play like a Pro guidelines since Level 1, it could be possible that 500 of each stat is trained by Level 100. However, selling Gold Forging tools is probably a must at some point to each it. A lot of the players in Britannia (120+) are maxed in stats which means that the riches of Britannia are enormous
- **Smart spending gold** - One of the requirements to be pro, as we mentioned, is to spend gold only in an efficient way. What does that mean? Yes, most of the gold is spent on training but there is significant gold wasted on, especially on low, mid and early high levels for various items or mercenary and for equipping all of your characters. One good advice is not to spend gold on buffs that you know you will replace easily, not to buy Auction House items that are 2x overpriced compared to vendor price (unless necessary, of course we are not skipping this awesome weapon or Mercenary, just because it is 2x vendor value) and not to go into stupid bidding wars with other players in the Auction House.
- **Be Active** - that goes without saying. You need to be very active. You should avoid having your cooldowns stay full. Don't let your Expedition points stay full. Same goes for Expedition points and your Underworld cooldowns. Being efficient doesn't mean you have to be a robot who stays online 24/7. If you play it smart, you could have breaks. Worst, mathematically speaking, is to have full cooldowns. Spend your God's favors on cooldown, Do not let your efficient packs such as Blessing pacts run out without noticing. Take rests from the game but just don't do it when full on expedition/dungeon/underworld points. Play on game events. There are at least 2 major events every month. Don't stay offline exactly for the events. They are always related to good buffs or extra expeditions that can bring you training cost reductions or a lot more to fight and farm gold and items from. Do small things like, exhausting all your expedition points before activating Dis Pater Normal costume. Watch your Centurio run out date and time and use Cervisia or other Centio +1 day boosts to maximize your Expedition points. Do not let Centurio expire when you are on full points as when you active you are not getting as much refunded. These things might feel like small or irrelevant in the bigger picture but they are not! They are huge long-term.

## Country View

The Country view button is where you can find the Hermit and the Expeditions

## Hermit

Hermit is an important character in Gladiatus.

![Hermit](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Hermit_menu.png "Hermit")

    ![Hermit](https://s30-en.gladiatus.gameforge.com/game/9194/img/npc/0/0_7.jpg "Hermit")

The Hermit is a different guy in every country

  A very arduous, small pathway leads you into the top of the nebulous mountains. At this remote place a hermit has his home, a man of wisdom and mystery. They say he lives here because he is able to hear the voices of the gods here. In a small cave, not far from the mountain top, sits a small and ragged man. Somehow you had imagined the hermit to be more impressive.   So what is the Hermit's purpose?

- **Traveling between Countries** (Italy, Africa, Germania and Britannia) for a cost of ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold"). Prices you can see on the Expeditions page.
 
Your current honour isn`t enough for you? You want to be praised in other countries?

- **Traveling to the Underworld** (Normal, Medium Hard)
 
To be able to enter the underworld you will first have to prove yourself in this world. (If you are below Level 100) - Come back to me once you have reached level 100.

- **Changing your character name** (you will need a token, look at [Treasury](/game-guide/pantheon/treasury "Treasury"))
 
Hihi. You want to make history with a more powerful name?

**official way** (Costs: 10% honour, 30.240 ![](https://s30-en.gladiatus.gameforge.com/game/9194/img/res2.gif "Gold"))   
Your documents are changed against a small charge. Thereby you loose some of your high profile.

**Bribe arena manager** (Costs: 1 ![](https://s30-en.gladiatus.gameforge.com/game/9194/img/premium/token_small/13.png))   
Your documents are being faked.

- **Changing your character gender** (you will need a token, look at [Treasury](/game-guide/pantheon/treasury "Treasury"))
 
You`re unhappy and don`t feel comfortable in your own skin? How about transforming your soul into another body?

Costs 20 ![Ruby](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_rubies.gif "Ruby")

## Expedition Basics

This will be a very basic guide on what Expeditions are. If you are looking for particular expedition opponents and info on them, check out the big [Expeditions](/expeditions "Expeditions") page.

Expeditions are the most essential part of the game. Expeditions are "areas' in the country that you can fight in and unlock at a certain level. Fighting in an expedition costs expedition points - ![Expedition points](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Expedition_point.png "Expedition points"). 1 Attack against and expedition opponent costs 1 ![Expedition points](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Expedition_point.png "Expedition points"). The normal amount of expedition points you have is 12. If you are using Centurio they become 24. With certain Micro Events or Dis Pater Normal Costume they can increase even further. Attacking an opponent and spending an expedition point triggers a cooldown. The default cooldown is 10 minutes, with Centurio 5 minutes and different Micro Events or Costume can decrease this cooldown even further. If you don't want to wait for the cooldown and you want to attack immediately, you can do so but it will cost you 1x ![Ruby](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_rubies.gif "Ruby") or 1x ![Holy Hourglass](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Holy_Hourglass.png "Holy Hourglass"). If you have ![Holy Hourglass](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Holy_Hourglass.png "Holy Hourglass") it will always take precedence over ![Ruby](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_rubies.gif "Ruby").

Now a little more about the expeditions

When you first enter an expedition you can only see the first opponent and the rest will be unknown

![Enemy Unknown](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/enemy_unknown.jpg "Enemy Unknown")

![Expedition layout](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Expedition_layout.png "Expedition layout")

Only when you defeat the opponent, the others will be unveiled. Every expedition is comprised of 4 opponents. 1-3 are normal opponents where 1 is the weakest, 2nd one is harder and the 3rd one is very hard. The 4th opponent is a Boss and you can recognize him with his special portrait. He is very very hard. Especially when fighting the expedition on its level range.

Expedition opponents grant the most ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold"), ![Honour](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_honor_small.gif "Honour") and ![Experience](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_level_small.gif "Experience") in Gladiatus. How much it really depends on the level of the Expedition opponents. If you hover your mouse on the expedition opponent portrait you will be presented with some info about this opponent

However, at first you will know very little about the opponent and you will have to learn it by fighting the opponent more and more.

![Enemy unknown](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Unknown_enemy_2.png "Enemy unknown")

This is how a completely learned opponent will look like

![Opponent stats](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Expeditions/Germania/Dragon_Remains/Dracolich_stats.png "Opponent stats")

However, this info is not very specific and will not give you exact details of the stats of the opponent. You can see this on the [Expeditions](/expeditions "Expeditions") page where I have a lot more info on expeditions in general.

Have in mind that [Event](/events "Event") expeditions and [Underworld](/underworld "Underworld") are also types of expeditions and the same rules apply there. More info on their respective sections and pages.

There is a chance to learn each of these bonuses on each attack you make against this opponent. The % chance to learn them depends on your Character's Intelligence stat. The more you have it the higher the chance to learn a bonus. If you don't want to wait you can immediately learn the bonus but it will cost you ![Ruby](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_rubies.gif "Ruby"). How much depends on what's your % chance to learn it from fighting. The higher the chance, the lower the price. This can be done by clicking on the bonus itself. If you only hover the bonus it will show you the bonus description and what is the % chance to learn it

![Chance to learn a bonus](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/learning_bonus_chance.png "Chance to learn a bonus")

There are 4 types of bonuses that can be learned and improved for each expedition opponent:

**Disembowler**

![Bonus Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/bonus_gold.jpg "Bonus Gold")

![Disembowler](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Disembowler.png "Disembowler")

**Analytical Battle**

**Sixth sense for loot**

**Storyteller**

![Storyteller](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Storyteller.png "Storyteller")

**Fighting in Expeditions**

So when you engage an expedition opponent you will be fighting him for 20 rounds or until someone dies (gets to 0 health points). In case nobody dies in these 20 rounds, the winner will be the one who did most damage in these 20 rounds.

You can observe the details of the fight, just after the fight on the battle report or after from the Battle reports interface

## Dungeons

Just like Expeditions, dungeons are a very essential part of the game. Dungeons are bigger challenges where the opponents are a lot stronger than expeditions but you go in and face them with a group of 5 people. These are not other players but these are NPCs that you recruit to fight with you. Let's start from the beginning. Dungeons become available at Level 10

![Dungeon annoucement](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Dungeons/Dungeon_ann.png "Dungeon annoucement")

So once you level up to 10, you will notice that there is a second character you can control. This is called the Dungeon character. He is just like your main character, should be equipped with items, can receive buffs. However, he doesn't need training as he will clone the stats of your main character. This means that if you have a pact boosting your stats, the dungeon character will receive them too. The dungeon character will only play part in your Dungeon and Arena Circus fights. He will not take any part in Expeditions or Arena fights so he will not have any need for healing.

![Dungeon characters view](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Dungeons/Dungeon_chars_view.png "Dungeon characters view")

We said that going into a Dungeon or a Circus Turma fight, the group will be of 5 characters. This is your dungeon character + 4 Mercenary that you can equip. Everything you need to know about the Mercenary types you can read on the [Mercenary](/game-guide/mercenary "Mercenary") page. Mercenary can be purchased from the Mercenary vendor or the Auction House. They don't drop from expeditions or dungeons.

This is where you can drag your Mercenary to activate them

![Mercenary slots](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Dungeons/Mercenary_slots.png "Mercenary slots")

Once the slot is populated with a Mercenary, another character tab will appear. Click it and you will see the stats of the Mercenary and open the character inventory. Just like any other character all 4 Mercenary need to be fully equipped with items. So essentially in total you need to take care of the gear of 6 characters. Main Character + Dungeon Character + 4 NPCs.

A party of 5 in any game is usually comprised of a Tank who will soak up damage, a healer who will heal the wounded characters and 3 damage dealers. All 5 dungeon characters, your dungeon char + the 4 Mercenary each has this function control. It can be found on the right upper side of the character inventory and it is there for the dungeon character or any of the 4 Mercenary.

![Dungeon character controls](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Dungeons/dungeon_function_command.png "Dungeon character controls")

What it basically does is it sets what this NPC will do in a dungeon fight. Tank, Heal or do damage.

So where can you find dungeons? Dungeons are tight to Expeditions. If the particular expedition has a dungeon there will be a Dungeon tab next to it

![Dungeon location](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Dungeons/Dungeon_location.png "Dungeon location")

If there is no Dungeon tab - it means that there is no dungeon in this expedition. For a complete list of dungeons check out the big [Dungeons](/dungeons "Dungeons") page.

So once you click the Dungeon tab you will be presented with the options to enter the dungeon.

![Enter Dungeon](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Dungeons/Enter_dungeon.png "Enter Dungeon")

Some expedition has a Normal and Advanced version of the dungeon where the Advanced version will be for a higher level

Once you enter the dungeon you will see the dungeon overview

![Dungeon overview](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Dungeons/Dungeon_overview.png "Dungeon overview")

Dungeons just like expeditions are based on attacks costing dungeon points - ![Dungeon point](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Dungeon_point.png "Dungeon point"). Attacks are made on the current active dungeon minion and you can attack by clicking the ![Combat](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Dungeons/combatloc.gif "Combat"). Same as expeditions, 12 points by default, 24 with Centurio and 48 with Dis Pater Medium costume. However, they regenerate slower than expedition points. Once every 1h 30 min without Centurio. Good to note that dungeons have timers to complete them. 48 hours (2 days) and if you don't complete it by then it will be reset to its beginning. The cooldown, same as expeditions is 5 minutes and can be lowered by Micro Events or costumes. If you want to skip the cooldown immediately, it cots 1x ![Ruby](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_rubies.gif "Ruby") or 1x ![Holy Hourglass](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Holy_Hourglass.png "Holy Hourglass"). If you have ![Holy Hourglass](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Holy_Hourglass.png "Holy Hourglass") it will always take precedence over ![Ruby](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_rubies.gif "Ruby").

You can also cancel a dungeon and start from the beginning whenever you want by clicking the Cancel dungeon button. Good use of the cancel button is where you are not strong enough to defeat the boss but you have already defeated the minions and there is nothing other than the boss to fight. In that case you can fight up to the boss and cancel dungeon to re-enter and that way you will be at least farming the minions for higher items instead of going back to a previous dungeon where you know you can complete it.

![Cancel Dungeon button](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Dungeons/Cancel_Dungeon_button.png "Cancel Dungeon button")

So once you start the dungeon you will be fighting dungeon minions and the end game is to kill the dungeon boss. The dungeon boss is a lot harder than the minions but his rewards are quite awesome. He always drops an item (100% chance) and this item is always at least of **Blue** quality.

To get to the boss you have to complete the dungeon quests. Dungeon quests are mostly concerned with just killing the minions but sometimes they are connected to finding an item to proceed ahead or just defeat some of the minions. Here is an example of quests in the [Hidden Grave](/dungeons/italy-dungeons/hidden-grave "Hidden Grave") dungeon.

![Dungeon quests example](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Dungeons/Dungeon_quests.png "Dungeon quests example")

Once you complete the quests the boss will be ready to be engaged. Defeating the boss completes the dungeon and you can startover

Dungeon minions and boss reward very few experience points and gold even on high levels. A dungeon opponent win will grant you gold, experience and instead of Honour - Fame. Fame is a stat that we talked about in the Character stats section of this page.

So for more info on the Dungeons go to the [Dungeons](/dungeons "Dungeons") page.
