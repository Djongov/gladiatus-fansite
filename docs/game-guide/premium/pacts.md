Pacts is one of the most fundamental premium features of the game. Pacts can be purchased for Rubies or be won at the Divine Chest of Faith for free.

There are 4 categories of pacts. A Pact of each category costs 15 ![Rubies](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_rubies.gif "Rubies") for 14 days or a token that drops from Divine Chest of Faith. You can switch from one pact to another **within the same category** but it has a 24 hour cooldown.

**Description:** You will become mightier than you ever dreamed of if you choose to make a pact with either the earthly or divine powers! But you will always have to keep in mind that you can only activate one pact from each category. We wouldn`t want the gods to argue about whose favourite you are; this would cause terrible chaos.
