## Strategic Value

Centurion is particularly valuable for:

- **Active players** who want to maximize daily expedition and dungeon runs
- **Guild members** contributing to guild building construction
- **PvP enthusiasts** who benefit from shorter arena cooldowns
- **Underworld explorers** who need the 100% Healing Potion
- **Efficiency-focused players** who want faster expedition and dungeon completion

The combination of doubled expedition/dungeon points (from 12 to 24) along with halved duration and faster regeneration makes Centurion one of the most impactful premium features for active gameplay.
