Britannia expeditions are the newest addition to the game targeting the high level characters at level 120+. For long they haven't had a real challenge in game and this new country has exactly this purpose. The country came with the 3.0.3 on 17/08/17 at 15:00 worldwide. Currently the downside is that there aren't any new dungeons so essentially the people running Britannia do not go into any dungeons.
