After long 6-8 levels in the last expedition of Germania, you move to a new land.

## Description

Galerius Senecianus\` Diary: DCXCIX a.u.c. We`ve finally found a suitable landing point! The journey through the night was difficult and I have not experienced such an uncomfortable climate in all my travels in the empire. Whilst sailing we have already been greeted with spears flung from the coastline. The local tribes, as it appears, will not be giving up without any resistance. Hopefully our large war barges will provide us with some covering fire as we land...

**Entry level:** 120

**Enemy levels:**: 130-140

**Real level to engage:** 120 (118 with Eagle Eyes costume)

**Dungeon:** No

**Advanced Dungeon:** No

**Additional Info:**

Long waited first expedition in Britannia. It is what you expect. Tougher opponents compared to Dragon Remains with very doable Bibroci and Ancalite without too much trouble and hard Cenimagni and Cassi. Bibroci has nothing special to offer in terms of stats and is not very generous with the item drops. From the test 100 defeats only 13 items dropped which is 13%. Ancalite is very high Damage and Armour as well as Charisma. A lot more generous with the drop rate than Bibroci. Cenimagni is tough. Very low on Armour (only 10K) but very high on stats. A lot of his stats are more than 1000. Damage is less than Ancalite which is good but you can feel that he is harder to beat than Ancalite when you try him. Cassi is very tanky. High agility, charisma and Armour and lower damage and dexterity. Quite generous with the drops though. He is manageable as the gear rises. You certainly need upgrades to your gear to beat him in a farm stats compared to Dracolich.
