Bandit Camp is comprised of deserters, criminals and smugglers from the city. Last expedition in Italy. Once you are done here, you won't return home anymore.

## Description

Near the city, hidden in the southern foothills of the Misty Mountains, there is a bandit camp. Bandits, smugglers, thieves and other outlaws bustle around there. Although the imperial legion sent troops there countless times, the camp was reconstructed every time.

**Entry level:** 70

**Enemy levels:** 80-88

**Real level to engage:** 70

**Dungeon:** No

**Advanced Dungeon:** No

**Additional Info:** Now this is a proper upgrade of an expedition. Difference from Barbarian Village to Bandit Camp is greater than the difference between Ancient Temple and Barbarian Village. Fight here if you can. The expedition doesn't have a dungeon on its own but this is where the Advanced Italy dungeons start to be accessible so you might want to stay here and fight. Interesting is that Assassinator is really hard and almost as good as the boss - Bandit Chief.
