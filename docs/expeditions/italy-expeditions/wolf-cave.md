Wolf Cave is the fourth expedition in the game and it allows you to enter at level 15.

## Description

In the hills south of the barbarian village there is a cave system that is called wolf cave by the townsfolk. As the name suggests, a large pack of wolves pack live there which often attack the surrounding farms during harsh winters. Some say this wolf pack is led by a large white wolf, but that may merely be the idle chitchat of simple farmers.

**Entry level:** 15

**Enemy levels:** 22-31

**Real level to engage:** 19

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[The Cave of Dark intrigue](/dungeons/italy-dungeons/the-cave-of-dark-intrigue "The Cave of Dark intrigue")** - Entry Level 10

**Advanced Dungeon:** Yes, **[Gioll Passage](/dungeons/italy-dungeons/gioll-passage "Gioll Passage")** - Entry Level 73

**Additional Info:** Typical expedition. Nothing unusual about it. Of course the low entry level doesn't mean that you can fight here at 15. Problem is that you will probably not fully discover the expedition as the fighting level is around 20 and at 20 you are able to travel to Africa. However, Africa is really hard at level 20 so you might want to stay here a bit longer and fight in Wolf Cave. What's interesting about the expedition is that the boss - Werewolf awards really good experience, this is if you are able to fight him without losing too much, otherwise he is not worth if you lose 50% of the fights.
