**Italy Expeditions**
=====================

Italy expeditions are the first one you encounter in the game. They include mostly low level expeditions and a couple of higher level ones. The stats on all enemies are without any bonuses.

<a id="Grimwood"></a>Grimwood
-----------------------------

Grimwood is the first expedition in the game. Do not get fooled by it. It has some fearsome animals. Rat is really weak but Lynx is far stronger and it doesn't scale exponentially. Same with Wolf and Bear. Do not expect to start farming Wolf and Bear anytime soon.

**Description**

If you believe what the old people say around here, there once lived a very popular king in this wood. The wood`s original name has been long forgotten and is now only known by the name Grimwood. Rumour has it, that this king made a pact with the dark side so that he could continue to reign forever. However, Grimwood is an extremely sinister place, full of wild animals and impenetrable brushwood. Countless numbers of hunters and lumberjacks went too deep into the woods, never to be seen again. If you believe the gossip, the old king took them into his lair so that they could serve him for all eternity...

**Entry level:** 1

**Enemy levels:** 1-10

**Real level to engage:** 1

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[Gustavos Country House](/dungeons/italy-dungeons "Gustavos Country House")** - Entry level 10

**Advanced Dungeon:** No

**Additional Info:** This is the first dungeon so Rat is really easy. Lynx could be easy but Lynx varies in levels too much - 2 to 5. The stats of a level 5 enemy could be too much for the beginner gladiator so do not fall into despair if you loose some of the battles against Lynx. Wolf is also strong so don't expect to start defeating him properly before level 5. The big question is whether you start trying the next expedition Pirate Harbour on level 5 or fight the Wolf. I would say stick with Wolf unless you are really twinked low level. The boss - Bear is really profitable if you could start beating it early (before level 8) because the Gold reward and experience are really high.

<a id="PirateHarbour"></a>Pirate Harbour
----------------------------------------

Pirate Harbour is the second expedition in the game and it's only 5 levels away. However 5 levels might be too quick.

**Description**

On the coast in the south-east there is a pirate harbour. There are a lot of shady characters and goods that would be forbidden elsewhere there. Uninvited guests aren`t welcome. Still, many adventurers and nosy people try their luck. Mostly they end up as food for the sharks. But if you bear up against all these pirates, you`ll get exotic treasures.

**Entry level:** 5

**Enemy levels:** 8-17

**Link to expedition: gladiatus.gamerz-bg.com/italy-expeditions#PirateHarbour**

**Real level to engage:** 7-8

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[On the Run](/dungeons/italy-dungeons "On the Run")** - Entry level 10

**Advanced Dungeon:** Yes, **[The Last Resort](/dungeons/italy-dungeons "The Last Resort")** - Entry level 68  


**Additional Info:** It becomes available too quickly. At level 5 you are most likely not able to kill Wolf in Grimwood even. If you are uber geared and twinked you may start with Fled Slave but that's not entirely easy. If you can fight without losing too many battles fight here. The experience and honour is not that much more than Grimwood but the gold is and gold is really important. Enemies gradually become harder with the boss - Captain raises to level 15-17 which in normal rates is almost impossible to beat at the low levels. Assassin is also really strong with huge variety in the levels. Gold boost is also big with Assassin and Captain.

<a id="MistyMountains"></a>Misty Mountains
------------------------------------------

Pirate Harbour is the third expedition in the game and it opens up at level 10 but not really doable at level 10, just like its dungeon.

**Description**

The highest pinnacles of the Misty Mountains are hidden from the eyes of wanderers, because of the thick clouds surrounding them. Well, it`s not as if many people go around there anyway. It is a dangerous area, not only because of the dangers from the mountains themselves, but also because it is said that there are monsters in the caves in the southern slopes - the sort longing for human meat...

**Entry level:** 10

**Enemy levels:** 15-27

**Link to detailed spreadsheet: [here](spreadsheets/Expeditions/Italy/Gladiatus-Italy-Expeditions-Misty-Mountains.xlsx "Misty Mountains")**

**Real level to engage:** 14-15

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[The Dragon Stronghold](/dungeons/italy-dungeons "The Dragon Stronghold")** - Entry Level 10

**Advanced Dungeon:** Yes, [**The True Owner**](/dungeons/italy-dungeons "The True Owner") - Entry Level 70

**Additional Info:** Same as Pirate Harbour, the entry level is a bit low for the creatures you have to fight in this expedition. The real level is more like 15. Elusive Recruit can be farmed easily but the rest are just plain hard. Harpy and Cerberus are jumping with 4-6 levels more which is insane. Same as Pirate Harbour, 3rd enemy and Boss are really a lot stronger than what you would be able to normally fight at this level.

<a id="WolfCave"></a>Wolf Cave
------------------------------

Wolf Cave is the fourth expedition in the game and it allows you to enter at level 15.

**Description**

In the hills south of the barbarian village there is a cave system that is called wolf cave by the townsfolk. As the name suggests, a large pack of wolves pack live there which often attack the surrounding farms during harsh winters. Some say this wolf pack is led by a large white wolf, but that may merely be the idle chitchat of simple farmers.

**Entry level:** 15

**Enemy levels:** 22-31

**Link to detailed spreadsheet: [here](spreadsheets/Expeditions/Italy/Gladiatus-Italy-Expeditions-WolfCave.xlsx "Wolf Cave")**

**Link to expedition: gladiatus.gamerz-bg.com/italy-expeditions#WolfCave** 

**Real level to engage:** 19

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[The Cave of Dark intrigue](/dungeons/italy-dungeons "The Cave of Dark intrigue")** - Entry Level 10

**Advanced Dungeon:** Yes, **[Gioll Passage](/dungeons/italy-dungeons "Gioll Passage")** - Entry Level 73

**Additional Info:** Typical expedition. Nothing unusual about it. Of course the low entry level doesn't mean that you can fight here at 15. Problem is that you will probably not fully discover the expedition as the fighting level is around 20 and at 20 you are able to travel to Africa. However, Africa is really hard at level 20 so you might want to stay here a bit longer and fight in Wolf Cave. What's interesting about the expedition is that the boss - Werewolf awards really good experience, this is if you are able to fight him without losing too much, otherwise he is not worth if you lose 50% of the fights.

<a id="AncientTemple"></a>Ancient Temple
----------------------------------------

Ancient Temple is the long waited return of our glorious gladiator to Italy. After a long absence you are finally home and it's time for the high level beasts to pay their dues.

**Description**

It is long forgotten for which God this temple was erected for. Nonetheless, the old, simple ruin still has an aura of mysticism and power. This distant place of worship towers majestically above the lowlands - the wind blows eerily through the old ruins and many animals are nested there. Still - or maybe even because of all this - treasure hunters come here time and again. There is still the rumour that the true treasure of the temple has never been found...

**Entry level:** 60

**Advanced Dungeon:** No

**Additional Info:** The expedition is the first one you encounter when you return to Italy from your adventures abroad. A very convenient and interesting dungeon sits in this expedition. What's interesting is that Cultist Guard is really good in terms of rewards. 2nd, 3rd and Boss are not huge difference compared to Cultist Guard in terms of treasure. However, Cultist has a lot of Armour. Rewards from the boss are really good. If you can fight him, go for it.

<a id="BarbarianVillage"></a>Barbarian Village
----------------------------------------------

Barbarian Village is an expedition that is second you will see since your return to Italy. Fairly strong enemies and really important dungeons.

**Description**

In the far east there is a barbarian village where barbarians live who have not yet acknowledged the greatness of the Roman Empire. Because they mug travellers and merchants every now and then, you are likely to find many treasures. As long as the Imperial Legion doesn`t take any steps against the barbarians, going there is still a daring adventure.

**Entry level:** 65

**Enemy levels:** 75-83

**Link to expedition: gladiatus.gamerz-bg.com/italy-expeditions#BarbarianVillage** 

**Real level to engage:** 65

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[In enemy hands](/dungeons/italy-dungeons "In enemy hands")** - Entry Level 65

**Advanced Dungeon:** Yes, [**Zagrash's Fort**](/dungeons/italy-dungeons "Zagrash's Fort") - Entry Level 78

**Additional Info:** What's typical for the barbarians is that they all have low armour. If you are doing fine in Ancient Temple you might not rush and start all over discovering and doing a new expedition. Rewards are not a lot greater than the Ancient Temple. What's fascinating is the damage of the Berserker. The boss is strong but good drops there.

<a id="BanditCamp"></a>Bandit Camp
----------------------------------

Bandit Camp is comprised of deserters, criminals and smugglers from the city. Last expedition in Italy. Once you are done here, you won't return home anymore.

**Description**

Near the city, hidden in the southern foothills of the Misty Mountains, there is a bandit camp. Bandits, smugglers, thieves and other outlaws bustle around there. Although the imperial legion sent troops there countless times, the camp was reconstructed every time.

**Entry level:** 70

**Enemy levels:** 80-88

**Link to expedition: gladiatus.gamerz-bg.com/italy-expeditions#BanditCamp** 

**Real level to engage:** 70

**Dungeon:** No

**Advanced Dungeon:** No

**Additional Info:** Now this is a proper upgrade of an expedition. Difference from Barbarian Village to Bandit Camp is greater than the difference between Ancient Temple and Barbarian Village. Fight here if you can. The expedition doesn't have a dungeon on its own but this is where the Advanced Italy dungeons start to be accessible so you might want to stay here and fight. Interesting is that Assassinator is really hard and almost as good as the boss- Bandit Chief.
