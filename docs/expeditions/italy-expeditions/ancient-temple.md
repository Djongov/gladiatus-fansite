Ancient Temple is the long waited return of our glorious gladiator to Italy. After a long absence you are finally home and it's time for the high level beasts to pay their dues.

## Description

It is long forgotten for which God this temple was erected for. Nonetheless, the old, simple ruin still has an aura of mysticism and power. This distant place of worship towers majestically above the lowlands - the wind blows eerily through the old ruins and many animals are nested there. Still - or maybe even because of all this - treasure hunters come here time and again. There is still the rumour that the true treasure of the temple has never been found...

**Entry level:** 60

**Enemy levels:**

**Real level to engage:** 60

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[Hidden Grave](/dungeons/italy-dungeons/hidden-grave "Hidden Grave")** - Entry Level 60

**Advanced Dungeon:** No

**Additional Info:** The expedition is the first one you encounter when you return to Italy from your adventures abroad. A very convenient and interesting dungeon sits in this expedition. What's interesting is that Cultist Guard is really good in terms of rewards. 2nd, 3rd and Boss are not huge difference compared to Cultist Guard in terms of treasure. However, Cultist has a lot of Armour. Rewards from the boss are really good. If you can fight him, go for it.
