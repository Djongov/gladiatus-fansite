Barbarian Village is an expedition that is second you will see since your return to Italy. Fairly strong enemies and really important dungeons.

## Description

In the far east there is a barbarian village where barbarians live who have not yet acknowledged the greatness of the Roman Empire. Because they mug travellers and merchants every now and then, you are likely to find many treasures. As long as the Imperial Legion doesn`t take any steps against the barbarians, going there is still a daring adventure.

**Entry level:** 65

**Enemy levels:** 75-83

**Real level to engage:** 65

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[In enemy hands](/dungeons/italy-dungeons/in-enemy-hands "In enemy hands")** - Entry Level 65

**Advanced Dungeon:** Yes, **[Zagrash's Fort](/dungeons/italy-dungeons/zagrashs-fort "Zagrash's Fort")** - Entry Level 78

**Additional Info:** What's typical for the barbarians is that they all have low armour. If you are doing fine in Ancient Temple you might not rush and start all over discovering and doing a new expedition. Rewards are not a lot greater than the Ancient Temple. What's fascinating is the damage of the Berserker. The boss is strong but good drops there.
