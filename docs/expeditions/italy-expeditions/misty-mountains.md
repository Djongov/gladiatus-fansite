Misty Mountains is the third expedition in the game and it opens up at level 10 but not really doable at level 10, just like its dungeon.

## Description

The highest pinnacles of the Misty Mountains are hidden from the eyes of wanderers, because of the thick clouds surrounding them. Well, it`s not as if many people go around there anyway. It is a dangerous area, not only because of the dangers from the mountains themselves, but also because it is said that there are monsters in the caves in the southern slopes - the sort longing for human meat...

**Entry level:** 10

**Enemy levels:** 15-27

**Real level to engage:** 14-15

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[The Dragon Stronghold](/dungeons/italy-dungeons/the-dragon-stronghold "The Dragon Stronghold")** - Entry Level 10

**Advanced Dungeon:** Yes, **[The True Owner](/dungeons/italy-dungeons/the-true-owner "The True Owner")** - Entry Level 70

**Additional Info:** Same as Pirate Harbour, the entry level is a bit low for the creatures you have to fight in this expedition. The real level is more like 15. Elusive Recruit can be farmed easily but the rest are just plain hard. Harpy and Cerberus are jumping with 4-6 levels more which is insane. Same as Pirate Harbour, 3rd enemy and Boss are really a lot stronger than what you would be able to normally fight at this level.
