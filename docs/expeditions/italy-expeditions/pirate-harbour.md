Pirate Harbour is the second expedition in the game and it's only 5 levels away. However 5 levels might be too quick.

## Description

On the coast in the south-east there is a pirate harbour. There are a lot of shady characters and goods that would be forbidden elsewhere there. Uninvited guests aren\`t welcome. Still, many adventurers and nosy people try their luck. Mostly they end up as food for the sharks. But if you bear up against all these pirates, you`ll get exotic treasures.

**Entry level:** 5

**Enemy levels:** 8-17

**Real level to engage:** 7-8

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[On the Run](/dungeons/italy-dungeons/on-the-run "On the Run")** - Entry level 10

**Advanced Dungeon:** Yes, **[The Last Resort](/dungeons/italy-dungeons/the-last-resort "The Last Resort")** - Entry level 68

**Additional Info:** It becomes available too quickly. At level 5 you are most likely not able to kill Wolf in Grimwood even. If you are uber geared and twinked you may start with Fled Slave but that's not entirely easy. If you can fight without losing too many battles fight here. The experience and honour is not that much more than Grimwood but the gold is and gold is really important. Enemies gradually become harder with the boss - Captain raises to level 15-17 which in normal rates is almost impossible to beat at the low levels. Assassin is also really strong with huge variety in the levels. Gold boost is also big with Assassin and Captain.
