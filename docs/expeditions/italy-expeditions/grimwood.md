However, Grimwood is an extremely sinister place, full of wild animals and impenetrable brushwood. Countless numbers of hunters and lumberjacks went too deep into the woods, never to be seen again. If you believe the gossip, the old king took them into his lair so that they could serve him for all eternity...

## Description

If you believe what the old people say around here, there once lived a very popular king in this wood. The wood`s original name has been long forgotten and is now only known by the name Grimwood. Rumour has it, that this king made a pact with the dark side so that he could continue to reign forever. However, Grimwood is an extremely sinister place, full of wild animals and impenetrable brushwood. Countless numbers of hunters and lumberjacks went too deep into the woods, never to be seen again. If you believe the gossip, the old king took them into his lair so that they could serve him for all eternity...

**Entry level:** 1

**Enemy levels:** 1-10

**Real level to engage:** 1

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[Gustavos Country House](/dungeons/italy-dungeons/gustavos-country-house "Gustavos Country House")** - Entry level 10

**Advanced Dungeon:** No

**Additional Info:** This is the first dungeon so Rat is really easy. Lynx could be easy but Lynx varies in levels too much - 2 to 5. The stats of a level 5 enemy could be too much for the beginner gladiator so do not fall into despair if you loose some of the battles against Lynx. Wolf is also strong so don't expect to start defeating him properly before level 5. The big question is whether you start trying the next expedition Pirate Harbour on level 5 or fight the Wolf. I would say stick with Wolf unless you are really twinked low level. The boss - Bear is really profitable if you could start beating it early (before level 8) because the Gold reward and experience are really high.
