Lost Harbour is the fourth expedition in Africa. It's the last expedition in Africa before going to Germania for the first time so enjoy is as you won't be coming back in a long time. It has interesting dungeons and expedition enemies.

## Description

Once a thriving Viking outpost, it has in the meantime become a shadow of its former self. A textbook example of the empire and its allies. The strange power of voodoo forced the blonde giants to their knees. It apparently still holds findings from the houses and ships of the Vikings, that aren`t of any interest to the Umpokta.

**Entry level:** 35  

**Enemy levels:** 45-53  

**Real level to engage:** 40-42  

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[Poisoned Country](/dungeons/africa-dungeons/poisoned-country "Poisoned Country")** - Entry Level 35

**Advanced Dungeon:** Yes, **[In the Heart of Decay](/dungeons/africa-dungeons/in-the-heart-of-decay "In the Heart of Decay")** - Entry Level 90  

**Additional Info:** Crocodile is pretty weak so it can be attacked easily at lower level. Undead Holder is not as strong as well because he has very low Dexterity which means that he won't be hitting you a lot. Giant Water Snake is strong but beatable as well. Mokele Mbembe is a special case. Can spawn as low as Level 48 and stats are good but not impossible. There is one problem however. Its non-penetrable armor makes him a though opponent. At 7-9.5k it consumes almost all the damage a level ~40 gladiator can do.
