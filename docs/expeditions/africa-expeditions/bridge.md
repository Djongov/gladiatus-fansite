Bridge is the second expedition in Africa and while it takes a lot to adapt once you arrive in Africa, this expedition seems to be a bit more reasonable. Fierce and aggressive tribe.

## Description

In the face of the climate and the local geology, wooden bridge constructions are not practical. For this reason the Empire built this unique piece of Roman engineering here in Africa. The Umpokta consider it a passage, which connects the world of life and the world of the dead. Numerous misunderstandings arise, due to this. Gladiators that guard the bridge are seen as guardians, who watch over the access to the afterlife.

**Entry level:** 25  

**Enemy levels:** 35-43  

**Real level to engage:** 32-33

**Dungeon:** Yes, [**Abducted**](/dungeons/africa-dungeons "Abducted") - Entry level 25

**Advanced Dungeon:** Yes, [**Under a Blood-red Sky**](/dungeons/africa-dungeons "Under a Blood-red Sky") - Entry level 86  

**Additional Info:** Funny how strong Man Eater is. You better stay with Tax Collector. Bone Shaman is really strong. Best if you farm Tax Collector until next expedition is available.
