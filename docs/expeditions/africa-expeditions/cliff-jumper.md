Cliff Jumper is the eighth expedition in Africa.

## Description

In the religious life of the Umpokta a surreal ritual has become tradition. On every third new moon the villages` priests meet and choose someone especially gifted. This person is accompanied by a procession to Cliffjumper Mountain. On arrival the chosen ones throw themselves jubilantly off the cliff to their deaths, it is said that it is a gift to the spirits. Aside from the spirits the numerous wild animals that have settled in this area also get some satisfaction from it.

**Entry level:** 90  

**Enemy levels:** 100-107  

**Real level to engage:** 90  

**Dungeon:** No

**Advanced Dungeon:** No  

**Additional Info:** This is the third of the pleasant high level African expeditions. Same as Mesoai-Oasis it is very standard. Weak Cursed Antelope and Giant Spider and very strong Shaman and High Shaman. High Shaman is considered one of the high end bosses in the game and is the highest creature in Africa. It's another question whether you will be able to effectively farm him until you leave this place on level 102 and to depart for Germania for good. Cursed Antelope has unnaturally low drop rate for items and Shaman seems to be drop really high item level, just like High Shaman. In your early 90s, try to farm Shaman or go back to Mesoai and try farming Demon Elephant. Mid 90's around level 95 you might be able to farm High Shaman more effectively. Do not farm him unless you win 9 out of 10 battles. It's just not worth it experience wise.
