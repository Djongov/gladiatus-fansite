Voodoo Temple is the first expedition in Africa.

## Description

It is the generous gift made by the Empire for the Umpokta. After the foundation walls and the building material were delivered, the Umpokta banished all Roman architects and finished constructing the building themselves. Religious reasons were pushed forward. Certainly the temple probably holds many secrets and treasures, which are protected by force of arms.

**Entry level:** 20  

**Enemy levels:** 30-38  

**Real level to engage:** 25  

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[Temple of Perdition](/dungeons/africa-dungeons "Temple of Perdition")** - Entry level 20

**Advanced Dungeon:** No  

**Additional Info:** The expedition is ready as soon as you are able to travel to Africa at the level of 20. However, enemies are level 30+ so fighting here on 20 is mission impossible. Perhaps if you are good geared you could pull it off on 25. The dungeon is as well too strong for a level 20 so in general don't bother coming at level 20 unless you know what you are doing. Interesting fact is that all of the enemies here are with very low HP and Constitution. Seth Priest is godly and practically unbeatable while you are on relevant level. Great rewards from him but Charisma is comparable to a level 50+ creature.
