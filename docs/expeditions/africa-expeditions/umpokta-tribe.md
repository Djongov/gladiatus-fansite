description: Umpokta Tribe is the fifth expedition in Africa. Really important one and is the first expedition that you will encounter for your big return to Africa after being in Germania and Italy. It has really crucial dungeons. It houses the Africa's high command. As far as the Empire is concerned, it is the high-point of civilisation amongst the savages of the savannah and deserts. Primitive house construction and religious superstition are very prevalent in everyday Umpokta life. With their masks and threatening songs they frighten the tenderly strung amongst our citizens.

Umpokta Tribe is the fifth expedition in Africa. Really important one and is the first expedition that you will encounter for your big return to Africa after being in Germania and Italy. It has really crucial dungeons. It houses the Africa's high command.

## Description

As far as the Empire is concerned, it is the high-point of civilisation amongst the savages of the savannah and deserts. Primitive house construction and religious superstition are very prevalent in everyday Umpokta life. With their masks and threatening songs they frighten the tenderly strung amongst our citizens.

**Entry level:** 75  

**Enemy levels:** 85-93  

**Real level to engage:** 75  

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[Fairground](/dungeons/africa-dungeons/fairground "Fairground")** - Entry level 80

**Advanced Dungeon:** Yes, **[Sasama's Last jouney](/dungeons/africa-dungeons/sasama-s-last-journey "Sasama's last journey")** - Entry level 80  

**Additional Info:** Now there are strange things about this expedition. Tribal Warrior and Tribal Magician are pretty doable. However Spirit Warrior has the 3rd biggest Armor in the game. Seth High Priest is one good example of a high end boss. His stats and rewards and treasures are so high that in terms of gold, experience and honour he is among the 110+ bosses. There is something weird about the expedition in my encounters. I did not encounter any item drops while there.
