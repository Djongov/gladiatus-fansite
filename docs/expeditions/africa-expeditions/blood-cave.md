Blood Cave is the third expedition in Africa.

## Description

There\`s a rumour amongst the superstitious natives that magical rituals are held here. The historiography of the empire writes of no such events taking place there. The fact is though, that the cave`s cooling shadows attracts deadly animals.

**Entry level:** 30  

**Enemy levels:** 40-48  

**Real level to engage:** 35  

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[Chamber of Pyro](/dungeons/africa-dungeons/chamber-of-pyro "Chamber of Pyro")** - Entry level 30

**Advanced Dungeon:** No  

**Additional Info:** Blood Wolf is pretty beatable. However Giant Beetle is really hard with an armour of 5-6k your attacks would not pierce with a lot of damage. Fire Dancer is not as strong as other 3rd expedition enemies compared to other expeditions. Same could be said for the Fire Demon. By far the strongest in the expedition but not as strong as other bosses compared to their expeditions.
