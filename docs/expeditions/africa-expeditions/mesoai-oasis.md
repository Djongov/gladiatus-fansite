Mesoai Oasis is the seventh expedition in Africa.

## Description

Fruitfully it lies in the desert and fearful are its dangers. As one of the few oases here in this region it is a place of refuge for many animals looking to quench their thirst. The shady trees offer shelter from the sun and offer predators the possibility of getting some food.

**Entry level:** 85  

**Enemy levels:** 95-102  

**Real level to engage:** 85  

**Dungeon:** No

**Advanced Dungeon:** No  

**Additional Info:** Just like Caravan this is a pleasant and on the spot expedition. Not to mention that the animals are really good looking. Nothing out of the ordinary. Weak 1 and 2 and strong 3rd in the face of Demon Lion. Demon Elephant is a jewel in terms of treasures. It can reach item level of 108 which is on the maximum frontier of your gear at this point and it will be a lot of purples. He can drop Ichorus so he might surprise you with a new weapon, especially if it rolls **Purple** or **Orange** quality.
