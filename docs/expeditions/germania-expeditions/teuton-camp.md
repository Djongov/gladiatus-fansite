The seventh expedition in Germania and quite a hard one.

## Description

The Romans fear the aggressive and wild Teutons who live in this camp. They kill anyone and everyone who approaches. Apparently they even skin animals and humans! Beyond that they use the skin and fur to dress themselves. A respected citizen of Rome can hardly even imagine such a thing. The forest looks kindly upon the barbarians, even if it stinks like mead and decay around them. Only the bravest, or should we say those undaunted by death, go anywhere near to those savages.

**Entry level:** 104

**Enemy levels:** 112-118

**Real level to engage:** 104 (for boss probably 108)

**Dungeon:** No

**Advanced Dungeon:** No

**Additional Info:** We can say a lot about Teuton Camp but the reality is that it is a lot harder than Mine and it becomes available a bit too quick. On 104 you have just managed to start farming Tatze comfortably which might cause a problem coming here. Seidr is extremely hard. Very decent geared gladiators at level 107+ would still have problems with him. He hits like a truck and is also really high in Agility which makes it hard to hit him back. This essentially makes him a lot harder than Tatze and this discourages gladiators of ever farming Teuton Camp properly. At this level you would only aim to farm the expedition boss so if you can't do it properly here, better not do it at all and stay back in Mine for as long as you have to and then swtich to Koman Mountain directly. Nevertheless, you should still strive to obtain all the bonuses for Seidr and get him ready as soon as possible if the opportunity to switch from Tatze to Seidr introduces itself.
