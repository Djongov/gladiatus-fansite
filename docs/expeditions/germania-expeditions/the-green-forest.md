The second expedition in Germania is the Green Forest.

## Description

Whoever likes green and aromatic things will find that the green forest is the perfect place for them. The odour of Taraxacum officinale, Viola riviniana or Oxalis acetosella bewitch the senses and give all the horrors, that emanate from the forest, some comfort. Wolves and bears suddenly start walking up-right and killing wanderers. The same goes for the usually friendly wolf pack. Whoever ventures into the forest at night can usually find magic ingredients, but the risk of dying is just a bit too much for the average citizen. But who ever even listens to the opinion of an average citizen?

**Entry level:** 45

**Enemy levels:** 55-63

**Real level to engage:** 45

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[With all its might](/dungeons/germania-dungeons "With all its might")** - Entry Level 45

**Advanced Dungeon:** Yes, **[Externsteine](/dungeons/germania-dungeons "Externsteine")** - Entry Level 102

**Additional Info:** Boar is really weak so it's doable as soon as you hit 45. You could try Swamp Lord because he is not very strong. You could even try Swamp Spirit. The creatures in this expedition are quite weak with the exception of the Werebear who, same as Soulless, is practically unbeatable on 45-50 levels. The Damage of the Werebear is Divine. It is 333 which is the damage of a 100 level creature.
