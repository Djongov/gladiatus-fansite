The most amazing expedition in the game. Marvelous creatures.

## Description

Majestically it stands there, the sacred Koman Mountain. Many mountaineers wish for nothing more than to climb this mountain. Unfortunately a lot of blood-thirsty animals living here have been responsible for converting the brave mountaineers into dead mountaineers. But of course something like that could never happen to a mighty Gladiator.

**Entry level:** 108

**Enemy levels:** 116-122

**Real level to engage:** 108 (for boss if good geared - 108/109)

**Dungeon:** No

**Advanced Dungeon:** No

**Additional Info:** Majestic creatures and majestic loot. This expedition houses some of the highest level creatures in the game. It is also home to the magnificent Dragon boss who has a main role in every gladiator's high level adventures. Infernal Springbok and Sabre-Tooth Tiger are weak. Dragon Whelp is very strong. A senior adventurer would find problems defeating the Dragon Whelp on occasions. Because Teuton Camp might be inconvenient for some gladiators, a lot of adventurers will find themselves in Koman Mountain coming straight from Mine and Tatzelwurm. For those who do that, coming here will be a brand new experience. The loot is so much better. By now you would have worn out Tatze's clothing which predominantly is in the 110-115 item level range. Dragon will drop items in their 120s item levels, award 20+ experience on kills (with bonuses) and gold in 15000s. A real beauty. The only problem is that Dragon is hard. The good news is that not much harder than Seidr. Actually sometimes it would feel that Seidr might be even stronger than Dragon. If you are trying Koman Mountain and the Dragon farm, do not allow more than 1 loss per 10 battles. Otherwise it would be better to continue safe with Tatze until you are truly ready for Koman Mountain. Perhaps a pact for Charisma and Agility and a good Orange/Red forged weapon will help you start farming Dragon comfortably even at 108 Level. Getting all bonuses, same as with Tatze and Seidr is absolutely mandatory.
