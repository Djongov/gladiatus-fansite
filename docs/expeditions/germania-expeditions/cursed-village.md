The third expedition in Germania. Things are getting serious now.

## Description

The fertile flora and fauna of the area attracts many tribes. That is why it is only a question of time before the Vandals will arrive as well. They are dreadful companions yet they brew heavenly beer and like to tell stories of their battles. While intoxicated they are very unpredictable and have a penchant for attacking strangers. Pray for a good moment should you have to stay with them for awhile.

**Entry level:** 50

**Enemy levels:** 60-68

**Real level to engage:** 50

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[Viking Camp](/dungeons/germania-dungeons/viking-camp "Viking Camp")** - Entry Level 50

**Advanced Dungeon:** No

**Additional Info:** Hun is really weak so you can start farming him as soon as you hit 50. Ancient is stronger than a usual 2nd. Has a lot of Damage and Armor. Nachzehrer is the same. Not great stats for a 3rd but the Armor and the Damage are really nasty and probably won't let you farm him. Abomination is not that impressive, he is just really though. High Agility and Armor makes his skin impenetrable.
