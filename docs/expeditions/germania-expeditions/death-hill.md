The fourth expedition in Germania is Death Hill. Relatively easy expedition.

## Description

The loss of the cave temple poses a considerable problem to the dwellers: Where to put the dead? Death Hill had for a long time been a perfect answer. Until the dead started rising and feeding off the carrion. Naturally this attracted allot of wild animals. Still many adventurers don`t let this story deter them from looting the riches found in the graves.

**Entry level:** 55

**Enemy levels:** 65-73

**Real level to engage:** 55

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[Mysterious Laboratory](/dungeons/germania-dungeons/mysterious-laboratory "Mysterious Laboratory")** - Entry level 80

**Advanced Dungeon:** No

**Additional Info:** What is special with this expedition are two things. First, all creatures are really weak. You can probably start farming Lich if you are a stronger than usual 55 Level. Necromancer Prince of course is a boss and won't expect to farm him but he is doable. Quite weaker than the rest of the bosses from previous expeditions here in Germania. The second special thing about Death Hill is that its dungeon is not for 55 Level. It's for 80 so you won't be changing the Viking Camp dungeon when you move on to this expedition.
