**Cave Temple**
--------------------------------------

The first expedition once you arrive in Germania is the Cave Temple.

**Description**

 

We are born from ashes and ashes we will become. Doesn`t it then make sense for us to devote a temple to the element that determines the cycle of life? If only there wasn`t that niggling fear. That it will eats its way into the souls of those who are supposed to be looking after the temple. And now the imposing, multi-story building stands stands deserted. Rumour has it that the fear living within the ruin of the building, has taken on a life of its own. It has supposedly got so strong that the dead buried there have risen from their graves. None of the priests that have tried to investigate this phenomenon have returned from temple. Perhaps you will have more luck or or ability?

 

**Entry level:** 40  


**Enemy levels:** 50-58

**The green forest**
-----------------------------------

The second expedition in Germania is the Green Forest.

**Description**

Whoever likes green and aromatic things will find that the green forest is the perfect place for them. The odour of Taraxacum officinale, Viola riviniana or Oxalis acetosella bewitch the senses and give all the horrors, that emanate from the forest, some comfort. Wolves and bears suddenly start walking up-right and killing wanderers. The same goes for the usually friendly wolf pack. Whoever ventures into the forest at night can usually find magic ingredients, but the risk of dying is just a bit too much for the average citizen. But who ever even listens to the opinion of an average citizen?

The Green Forest is a bit hard. No problem in beating the Giant Wild Boar but the rest was hard. Swamp Spirit is so hard that I never had the chance to see who the Expedition Boss is

**Entry level:** 45  


**Enemy levels:** 55-63

**Advanced Dungeon:** Yes,[ **Externsteine**](/dungeons/germania-dungeons "Externsteine") - Entry Level 102  


**Additional Info:** Boar is really weak so it's doable as soon as you hit 45. You could try Swamp Lord because he is not very strong. You could even try Swamp Spirit. The creatures in this expedition are quite weak with the exception of the Werebear who, same as Soulless, is practically unbeatable on 45-50 levels. The Damage of the Werebear is Divine. It is 333 which is the damage of a 100 level creature.

**Cursed Village** 
---------------------------------------------

The third expedition in Germania. Things are getting serious now.

**Description**

The fertile flora and fauna of the area attracts many tribes. That is why it is only a question of time before the Vandals will arrive as well. They are dreadful companions yet they brew heavenly beer and like to tell stories of their battles. While intoxicated they are very unpredictable and have a penchant for attacking strangers. Pray for a good moment should you have to stay with them for awhile.

**Entry level: 50** 

**Enemy levels: 60-68**

**Real level to engage:**

**Dungeon:** Yes, [**Viking Camp**](/dungeons/germania-dungeons "Viking Camp") - Entry Level 50

**Advanced Dungeon:** No  


**Additional Info:** Hun is really weak so you can start farming him as soon as you hit 50. Ancient is stronger than a usual 2nd. Has a lot of Damage and Armor. Nachzehrer is the same. Not great stats for a 3rd but the Armor and the Damage are really nasty and probably won't let you farm him. Abomination is not that impressive, he is just really though. High Agility and Armor makes his skin impenetrable.

## Death Hill
--------------------------------

The fourth expedition in Germania is Death Hill. Relatively easy expedition.

**Description**

The loss of the cave temple poses a considerable problem to the dwellers: Where to put the dead? Death Hill had for a long time been a perfect answer. Until the dead started rising and feeding off the carrion. Naturally this attracted allot of wild animals. Still many adventurers don`t let this story deter them from looting the riches found in the graves.

**Entry level:** 55  


**Enemy levels:** 65-73

**Real level to engage:** 55  


**Dungeon:** Yes, [**Mysterious Laboratory**](/dungeons/germania-dungeons "Mysterious Laboratory") - Entry level **80**

**Advanced Dungeon:** No  


**Additional Info:** What is special with this expedition are two things. First, all creatures are really weak. You can probably start farming Lich if you are a stronger than usual 55 Level. Necromancer Prince of course is a boss and won't expect to farm him but he is doable. Quite weaker than the rest of the bosses from previous expeditions here in Germania. The second special thing about Death Hill is that its dungeon is not for 55 Level. It's for 80 so you won't be changing the Viking Camp dungeon when you move on to this expedition.

## Vandal Village
----------------------------------------

The fifth expedition in Germania is Vandal Village. It is a high level expedition which means that you will visit it on your next return to Germania.

**Description**

The fertile flora and fauna of the area attracts many tribes. That is why it is only a question of time before the Vandals will arrive as well. They are dreadful companions yet they brew heavenly beer and like to tell stories of their battles. While intoxicated they are very unpredictable and have a penchant for attacking strangers. Pray for a good moment should you have to stay with them for awhile.

**Entry level:** 95  


**Enemy levels:** 104-110

**Real level to engage:** 95  


**Dungeon:** No

**Advanced Dungeon:** No  


**Additional Info:** Vandal Village is the first high level expedition which you will encounter on your 2nd and last return to Germania after Africa and Cliff Jumper. The expedition should pose a lot of difficulties as the journeys in high level Africa must have been fruitful and you should be coming back to Germania good geared. Farming Africa's Caravan, Mesoai-Oasis and Cliff Jumper would make any gladiator ready for high level Germania and Vandal Village. Time to play with the big boys and the phat loot. Vandal Warrior is very weak, as well as Jarl. Jarl might give you some problems at first but you will be farming him anytime soon if not immediately. Dark Fighter unfortunately is another story. High stat, insanely high Armor he might be too big a bite. Death Knight is even worse. He is a proper high level expedition boss so you have to pretty wild in order to farm him. What you need to concentrate while in Vandal Village is how to level up quickly to 100 and move on to Mine.

## Mine
---------------------

The sixth expedition in Germania is the most pleasant one. Weak opponents, good treasures.

**Description**

The pride of this region is its pure ore, which is stored in the mine. But for a while now a wolf pack has been living inside the mine. Nobody knows why they are there!..The workers have already themselves for the new dangerous work situation. Every loss is painful, but the region cannot live without ore. Everyone who will help them will be celebrated like a Caesar!

**Entry level:** 100  


**Enemy levels:** 108-114  


**Link to detailed spreadsheet: [here](spreadsheets/Expeditions/Germania/Gladiatus-Germania-Expeditions-Mine.xlsx "Mine")**

**Link to this expedition: gladiatus.gamerz-bg.com/germania-expeditions#Mine** 

**Real level to engage:** 100 (for boss probably 102-3)  


**Dungeon:** No

**Advanced Dungeon:** No  


**Additional Info:** Mine is the first expedition that can let you drop and farm Orange items, although with latest patches it is possible for an Orange to drop earlier, here i where it all starts to get serious. Leveling after 100 becomes slow so you have time to get strong and start farming the expedition boss. Something that by now you probably didn't manage to do effectively. Well, now you will start doing it. Get strong and gear up to the point that you would comfortably farm Tatzelwurm. Before you can farm Tatze, go for all 3 opponents. Get ![30% Bonus Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/bonus_gold.jpg "30% Bonus Gold")![30% Bonus XP](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/bonus_exp.jpg "30% Bonus XP")![10% more to find an item](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/bonus_loot.jpg "10% more to find an item")![20% more Honour](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/bonus_honour.jpg "20% more Honour") on all 3 so you can be prepared to farm Tatze on the maximum rewards. Do not think to rush anywhere. Teuton Camp will become available while you farm Tatze but Teuton Camp will not be as farmable as Mine so you would stay in mine a lot longer than you think. Months if not years. In terms of stats, Stone Golem and Tatze are actually quite good. It's just that the gladiators at this level start to level up very slowly and have time to gear up properly.

## Teuton Camp
----------------------------------

The seventh expedition in Germania and quite a hard one.

**Description**

The Romans fear the aggressive and wild Teutons who live in this camp. They kill anyone and everyone who approaches. Apparently they even skin animals and humans! Beyond that they use the skin and fur to dress themselves. A respected citizen of Rome can hardly even imagine such a thing. The forest looks kindly upon the barbarians, even if it stinks like mead and decay around them. Only the bravest, or should we say those undaunted by death, go anywhere near to those savages.

**Entry level:** 104  


**Enemy levels:** 112-118  


**Link to detailed spreadsheet: [here](spreadsheets/Expeditions/Germania/Gladiatus-Germania-Expeditions-Teuton-Camp.xlsx "Teuton Camp")**

**Link to this expedition: gladiatus.gamerz-bg.com/germania-expeditions#TeutonCamp** 

**Real level to engage:** 104 (for boss probably 108)  


**Dungeon:** No

**Advanced Dungeon:** No  


**Additional Info:** We can say a lot about Teuton Camp but the reality is that it is a lot harder than Mine and it becomes available a bit too quick. On 104 you have just managed to start farming Tatze comfortably which might cause a problem coming here. Seidr is extremely hard. Very decent geared gladiators at level 107+ would still have problems with him. He hits like a truck and is also really high in Agility which makes it hard to hit him back. This essentially makes him a lot harder than Tatze and this discourages gladiators of ever farming Teuton Camp properly. At this level you would only aim to farm the expedition boss so if you can't do it properly here, better not do it at all and stay back in Mine for as long as you have to and then swtich to Koman Mountain directly. Nevertheless, you should still strive to obtain all the bonuses for Seidr and get him ready as soon as possible if the opportunity to switch from Tatze to Seidr introduces itself.

## Koman Mountain
----------------------------------------

The most amazing expedition in the game. Marvelous creatures.

**Description**

Majestically it stands there, the sacred Koman Mountain. Many mountaineers wish for nothing more than to climb this mountain. Unfortunately a lot of blood-thirsty animals living here have been responsible for converting the brave mountaineers into dead mountaineers. But of course something like that could never happen to a mighty Gladiator.

**Entry level:** 108  


**Enemy levels:** 116-122  


**Link to detailed spreadsheet: [here](spreadsheets/Expeditions/Germania/Gladiatus-Germania-Expeditions-Koman-Mountains.xlsx "Koman Mountain")**

**Link to this expedition: gladiatus.gamerz-bg.com/germania-expeditions#KomanMountain** 

**Real level to engage:** 108 (for boss if good geared - 108/109)  


**Dungeon:** No

**Advanced Dungeon:** No  


**Additional Info:** Majestic creatures and majestic loot. This expedition houses some of the highest level creatures in the game. It is also home to the magnificent Dragon boss who has a main role in every gladiator's high level adventures. Infernal Springbok and Sabre-Tooth Tiger are weak. Dragon Whelp is very strong. A senior adventurer would find problems defeating the Dragon Whelp on occasions. Because Teuton Camp might be inconvenient for some gladiators, a lot of adventurers will find themselves in Koman Mountain coming straight from Mine and Tatzelwurm. For those who do that, coming here will be a brand new experience. The loot is so much better. By now you would have worn out Tatze's clothing which predominantly is in the 110-115 item level range. Dragon will drop items in their 120s item levels, award 20+ experience on kills (with bonuses) and gold in 15000s. A real beauty. The only problem is that Dragon is hard. The good news is that not much harder than Seidr. Actually sometimes it would feel that Seidr might be even stronger than Dragon. If you are trying Koman Mountain and the Dragon farm, do not allow more than 1 loss per 10 battles. Otherwise it would be better to continue safe with Tatze until you are truly ready for Koman Mountain. Perhaps a pact for Charisma and Agility and a good Orange/Red forged weapon will help you start farming Dragon comfortably even at 108 Level. Getting all bonuses, same as with Tatze and Seidr is absolutely mandatory.

## Dragon Remains
----------------------------------------

The last expedition in the game. Only for the best gladiators.

**Description**

Anyone can feel his skin crawl when they reach this place. Magic passes through the scattered dragon bones. But this amount of free magic can not go unnoticed and the creatures who hunger for this force are drawn to this place. They claim that space and have set watchmen to guard it. But with great power comes great madness and famine that now threatens to engulf everything.

**Entry level: 112** 

**Enemy levels: 120-126** 

**Link to detailed spreadsheet: [here](spreadsheets/Expeditions/Germania/Gladiatus-Germania-Expeditions-Dragon_Remains.xlsx "Dragon Remains")**

**Link to this expedition: gladiatus.gamerz-bg.com/germania-expeditions#DragonRemains** 

**Real level to engage: 112 (112 should be doable for Dracolich)** 

**Dungeon:** Yes, **Late Revenge** - Entry Level 112

**Advanced Dungeon:** Yes, **Alpha & Omega** - Entry Level 120  


**Additional Info:** Dragon Remains was introduced into the game with the sole intention to solve the problem of high level gladiators having no challenges. In terms of expedition we can hardly say that Dragon Remains is anything unusual. The stats gradually raise over Koman Mountain and so is the loot. But that's only gradually. The real interesting part are the two new dungeons! As soon as you hit level 110, put on your Eagly Eyes costume and come here and start building your path for later levels. Because of Dis Pater costumes a lot of the time you won't be able to properly fight here before level 112 but it will be enough to get you ready for Dracolich. Leveling at 110 is so slow that by the time you hit 112 and be able to normally come to this expedition you should prepare to give it a try against Dracolich but be prepared - he is a formidable foe and is harder than Dragon from Koman Mountain. As for the creatures in the expedition. Lemures has 2-3k Armour which is puny. Same goes for Ritualist. He might be weaker than his Koman Mountain counterpart - Dragon Whelp.
