The sixth expedition in Germania is the most pleasant one. Weak opponents, good treasures.

## Description

The pride of this region is its pure ore, which is stored in the mine. But for a while now a wolf pack has been living inside the mine. Nobody knows why they are there!..The workers have already themselves for the new dangerous work situation. Every loss is painful, but the region cannot live without ore. Everyone who will help them will be celebrated like a Caesar!

**Entry level:** 100

**Enemy levels:** 108-114

**Real level to engage:** 100 (for boss probably 102-3)

**Dungeon:** No

**Advanced Dungeon:** No

**Additional Info:** Mine is the first expedition that can let you drop and farm Orange items, although with latest patches it is possible for an Orange to drop earlier, here i where it all starts to get serious. Leveling after 100 becomes slow so you have time to get strong and start farming the expedition boss. Something that by now you probably didn't manage to do effectively. Well, now you will start doing it. Get strong and gear up to the point that you would comfortably farm Tatzelwurm. Before you can farm Tatze, go for all 3 opponents. Get all 4 extra bonuses by farming him so you can be prepared to farm Tatze on the maximum rewards. Do not think to rush anywhere. Teuton Camp will become available while you farm Tatze but Teuton Camp will not be as farmable as Mine so you would stay in mine a lot longer than you think. Months if not years. In terms of stats, Stone Golem and Tatze are actually quite good. It's just that the gladiators at this level start to level up very slowly and have time to gear up properly.
