The last expedition in Germania.

## Description

Anyone can feel his skin crawl when they reach this place. Magic passes through the scattered dragon bones. But this amount of free magic can not go unnoticed and the creatures who hunger for this force are drawn to this place. They claim that space and have set watchmen to guard it. But with great power comes great madness and famine that now threatens to engulf everything.

**Entry level:** 112

**Enemy levels:** 120-126

**Real level to engage:** 112 (112 should be doable for Dracolich)

**Dungeon:** Yes, **[Late Revenge](/dungeons/germania-dungeons/late-revenge "Late Revenge")** - Entry level 112

**Advanced Dungeon:** Yes, **[Alpha & Omega](/dungeons/germania-dungeons/alpha-omega "Alpha & Omega")** - Entry level 120

**Additional Info:** Dragon Remains was introduced into the game with the sole intention to solve the problem of high level gladiators having no challenges. In terms of expedition we can hardly say that Dragon Remains is anything unusual. The stats gradually raise over Koman Mountain and so is the loot. But that's only gradually. The real interesting part are the two new dungeons! As soon as you hit level 110, put on your Eagly Eyes costume and come here and start building your path for later levels. Because of Dis Pater costumes a lot of the time you won't be able to properly fight here before level 112 but it will be enough to get you ready for Dracolich. Leveling at 110 is so slow that by the time you hit 112 and be able to normally come to this expedition you should prepare to give it a try against Dracolich but be prepared - he is a formidable foe and is harder than Dragon from Koman Mountain. As for the creatures in the expedition. Lemures has 2-3k Armour which is puny. Same goes for Ritualist. He might be weaker than his Koman Mountain counterpart - Dragon Whelp.
