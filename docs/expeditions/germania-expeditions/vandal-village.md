The fifth expedition in Germania is Vandal Village. It is a high level expedition which means that you will visit it on your next return to Germania.

## Description

The fertile flora and fauna of the area attracts many tribes. That is why it is only a question of time before the Vandals will arrive as well. They are dreadful companions yet they brew heavenly beer and like to tell stories of their battles. While intoxicated they are very unpredictable and have a penchant for attacking strangers. Pray for a good moment should you have to stay with them for awhile.

**Entry level:** 95

**Enemy levels:** 104-110

**Real level to engage:** 95

**Dungeon:** No

**Advanced Dungeon:** No

**Additional Info:** Vandal Village is the first high level expedition which you will encounter on your 2nd and last return to Germania after Africa and Cliff Jumper. The expedition should pose a lot of difficulties as the journeys in high level Africa must have been fruitful and you should be coming back to Germania good geared. Farming Africa's Caravan, Mesoai-Oasis and Cliff Jumper would make any gladiator ready for high level Germania and Vandal Village. Time to play with the big boys and the phat loot. Vandal Warrior is very weak, as well as Jarl. Jarl might give you some problems at first but you will be farming him anytime soon if not immediately. Dark Fighter unfortunately is another story. High stat, insanely high Armor he might be too big a bite. Death Knight is even worse. He is a proper high level expedition boss so you have to pretty wild in order to farm him. What you need to concentrate while in Vandal Village is how to level up quickly to 100 and move on to Mine.
