## Recipes
---------------------------

Recipes, not to be mistaken for Scrolls are recipes that can be used in the Guild building - Library. A recipe can be activated for X amount of ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold") depending on the level of the recipe and can increase stats for all the gladiators in a guild for 4 hours. They are very close to what reinforcements are but are guild-wide effects. The higher the level of the recipe, the more stats it will increase but also the cost and cooldown will increase as well.

The recipe itself does not provide a lot of info in its description. Only when put into the Guild Library, you get more info such as how much stats it will boost, how much it will cost
