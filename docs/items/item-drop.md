## **Item Drop**
------------------------------

Estimations are that on average the drop rate are around these values. These numbers are from a research on 20 gladiators and their own % drop over the last 7 years. **Red** drops are so rare that this number is mostly prediction while the other 4 for Green-Orange are pure math average.

    **Average**   **Green** 68.58%   **Blue** 27.40%   **Purple** 3.30%   **Orange** 0.70%   **Red** 0.01%   Now there are some specifics for item drops:

\- Expedition drop is situated at around 40% base drop. This can be increased with Dis Pater Normal costume (becomes 100%), different event buffs throughout the year, Secret knowledge of the artifact collector pact (+15%), Bubona's Bull Armor 3 piece (+5%)

\- Dungeon drop is naturally higher than expedition drop and is around 80%. This can be increased to 100% with Dis Pater Medium costume and different event buffs throughout the year and Secret knowledge of the artifact collector pact (+15%)

\- Dungeon boss always drops an item and the item is always at least **Blue** quality

\- Expedition bosses always drop an item at least **Blue** in quality but not 100% drop like dungeon bosses

\- Item drops from Expeditions are Soul bound while the drops from Dungeons are not and can be sold and worn by other players

\- Auction house can spawn items up to **Purple**, including Mercenaries although extremely rare

\- Vendors like Weapon smith, Armour Smith or Alchemist can also spawn items up to **Red**

\- Items gold cost raises with their level both when buying or selling them

\- Expedition opponent will only drop items with item level as high as you can wear even if it can drop higher in general. Example: Dracolich in Dragon Remains can drop as high as item level 134 but if you are level 113 he will not drop beyond what you can wear at that level, which is 129 (character level +16)
