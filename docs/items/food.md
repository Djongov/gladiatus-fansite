## Food (Usable)
------------------------------

Some facts about food:

- There are 21 food items in the game
- Food can drop from mobs, be rewarded from quests, be purchased from General vendor, Auction house, Market
- There are "basic foods" and "complex" foods
- Only basic food is sold in the General vendor and the Auction house
- The "complex foods" are not sold in the General vendor and the Auction house. They can be obtained as quest rewards, dropped by mobs or created by combining certain basic foods (more below)
- Foods just like any other item can have prefixes and suffixes but they are not contributing in any way to how potent a food is
- Foods just like any other item can be in **White**, Green, **Blue**, **Purple**, **Orange** or **Red** quality
- How much a food heals for depends on: item level of the food + type of food + Intelligence + quality color of the food
- If you buy food from the other players in the Market, make sure it's not soul bound to the seller. You won't be able to use it if it is and you will waste your ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold")
- When you combine different quality color foods - the combined food will take the quality color of the receiving food. Example: If you are combining a **Blue** Apple and a Green Chicken the combined Feast will be of Green quality
 
The description of a food gives you the prefix, food name and suffix. It shows for how much it will heal you and how much of this is from intelligence. It also gives you a hint with what you can combine this food and the item level of the food.

**Is it worth combining foods?**

Well the short answer is Yes. Here is an example of combining two foods:

![Combining food](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/Food_combining.png "Combining food")

Let's look at the healing powers. Banana 3950 + Bread 6164 (blue) = Banana Sandwich (blue) 11231. On their own, 3950 + 6164 = 10114 which is less than the combed food sandwich 11231. It's worth combining food. They use less inventory space too.

Hint! Because of the rule that the final color of the mixed food is always the one of the receiving food, it might not always be beneficial to combine foods. If the receiving food is Green and the adding food is **Blue** or higher it might lead to less healing power. Especially when the adding food is higher than **Blue** quality, them it's almost never beneficial to combine them. Example:

**Banana** + **Bread** = **Banana Sandwich** = OK

**Banana** + **Bread** = **Banana Sandwich** = Could be OK or difference hardly noticeable

**Banana** + **Bread** = **Banana Sandwich** = NOT OK because the foods separate will heal for more than a green Banana Sandwich

**Banana** + **Bread** = **Banana Sandwich** = Better than the above, the final food will heal for less than individual but may not be noticeable

and so on. You get the idea. Sometimes foods might not be beneficial to combine because they become too power and will overheal you. For example:

**Banana** + **Bread** = **Banana Sandwich** = Could heal for a lot more than your total HP. Then it's a waste. This is even more true about more potential foods in general like Steak or Cheese Sandwich.

    **Special food**
-----------------------------------------

    There is food that is special and does not drop outside of special events. Look at the [events](/events "events") page for more info.

    **Mulsum**

![Mulsum](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/img/Food/special_food/Mulsum.gif "Mulsum")

Resets quest cooldown. Make sure you use it when NOT at max quests or when you have longer cooldown on your quest

    **Rebellum**

![Rebellum](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/img/Food/special_food/Rebellum.gif "Rebellum")

Adds 1 Ruby

    **Vinum**

**![Vinum](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/img/Food/special_food/Vinum.gif "Vinum")**

Resets expedition cooldown

    **Cervisia**

**![Cervisia](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/img/Food/special_food/Cervisia.gif "Cervisia")**

1 day of Centurio. Make sure you use your Cervisia when you don't have Centurio on because when you activate Centurio (even with Cervisia) you gain free expedition/dungeon points. So better to save your Cervisia for when your Centurio expires and then use it when low on expedition/dungeon points. It's much better than just adding 1 more day to your Centurio and make it from 14 days to 15 days

    **Korma**

**![Korma](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/img/Food/special_food/Korma.gif "Korma")**
