## Upgrades
-----------------------------

Upgrades are items that permanently increase a certain stats when applied to an item. The higher the item level of the upgrade item the higher the stats it will increase. Most upgrade items have a minimum item level that they can be applied to so be aware of it. Also, if you are buying an Upgrade item from the Market, make sure it's not Soul bound to the seller because if it is, you will not be able to use it.

    **Dusts**

Dusts are temporary 1 hour buffs that increase one of your main character stats for a period of time. Dusts cannot be purchased from Auction house or vendors and only drop from mobs. Please note that these do not exceed the maximum stat of your character, so if you are at the maximum stat this will not have any effect
