In Gladiatus an item is formed from a base item to which a prefix, suffix or both can be applied at the same time.

Here is an example:

We have an item - Club

<ItemTooltip
  name="Club"
  rarity="green"
  image="https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/img/Weapons/Club.png"
  damage="1 – 3"
  level={1}
  stats={[
  ]}
  gold="14"
/>

![Club](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/img/Weapons/Club.png "Club")

![Club stats](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/img/Weapons/Club_stats.png "Club stats")

Club has basic item level of 1. Then we apply a Prefix and the stats from the prefix are applied to the Club. However, every prefix adds item levels to the base item. The formula is scroll level -10. In our example we will use Taliths. Taliths scroll is 55 item level, which means that it will add 45 levels to the Club

![Taliths prefix](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/Prefixes/Taliths.png "Taliths prefix")

So base level of Club is 1 + 45 levels from Taliths prefix and the result is Taliths Club (46 item level)

![Taliths Club](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/Taliths_Club.png "Taliths Club")

Now, let's apply a Suffix. Suffixes work the same way as Prefixes. It will add the stats from the suffix to our item + item levels (scroll -10). Let's use "of Fatuity"

![of Fatuity suffix](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/Suffixes/of_Fatuity.png "of Fatuity suffix")

In our case Fatuity will add 46-10=36 item levels to our Taliths Club

![Taliths Club of Fatuity](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/Taliths_Club_of_Fatuity.png "Taliths Club of Fatuity")

So the result is Taliths Club of Fatuity. All the stats from the prefix and the suffix are added to the item as well as item levels 1+45+36=82

This is how item is formed.

**Interesting fact!** Did you know that you can't have certain stats on certain item slots in Gladiatus

- You can't have Charisma +% on Shields
- You can't have Agility +% on Chest Armours
- You can't have Dexterity +% on Shoes
- You can't have Strength +% on Jewelry (Amulets and Rings)
 
Example:

"of Suffering", i am using this suffix because it has both Agility and Charisma and is good for example but this applies to both prefixes and suffixes:

Agility +21%

Charisma +17%

![of Suffering](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/Suffixes/of_Suffering.png "of Suffering")

This is how a normal "of Suffering" items looks like:

![Amulet of Suffering](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/Suffixes/Examples/Amulet_of_Suffering.png "Amulet of Suffering")

However, If you decide to use it on an Chest Armour - there is no Agility! In fact there cannot be + "Agility %" on any Chest Armour in Gladiatus! No matter what suffix or prefix you use. You can have Agility +X but not Agility +XX%

![Chest armour of Suffering](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/Suffixes/Examples/Chest_Armour_of_Suffering.png "Chest armour of Suffering")

If you decide to use it on a Shield - there is no Charisma % on shields! Just like the Chest Armours are with Agility, shields cannot have Charisma +XX %. You can have Charisma +XX but not Charisma +XX%

![Shield of Suffering](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/Suffixes/Examples/Shield_of_Suffering.png "Shield of Suffering")

This is the same with Dexterity on shoes and Strength on Amulets!!!

So have this in mind when you are looking for the best item to help you max your stats.
