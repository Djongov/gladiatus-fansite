## **Item formation** {#formation}
----------------------------------------

In Gladiatus an item is formed from a base item to which a prefix, suffix or both can be applied at the same time.

Here is an example:

We have an item - Club

![Club](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/img/Weapons/Club.png "Club")

![Club stats](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/img/Weapons/Club_stats.png "Club stats")

Club has basic item level of 1. Then we apply a Prefix and the stats from the prefix are applied to the Club. However, every prefix adds item levels to the base item. The formula is scroll level -10. In our example we will use Taliths. Taliths scroll is 55 item level, which means that it will add 45 levels to the Club

![Taliths prefix](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/Prefixes/Taliths.png "Taliths prefix")

So base level of Club is 1 + 45 levels from Taliths prefix and the result is Taliths Club (46 item level)

![Taliths Club](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/Taliths_Club.png "Taliths Club")

Now, let's apply a Suffix. Suffixes work the same way as Prefixes. It will add the stats from the suffix to our item + item levels (scroll -10). Let's use "of Fatuity"

![of Fatuity suffix](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/Suffixes/of_Fatuity.png "of Fatuity suffix")

In our case Fatuity will add 46-10=36 item levels to our Taliths Club

![Taliths Club of Fatuity](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/Taliths_Club_of_Fatuity.png "Taliths Club of Fatuity")

So the result is Taliths Club of Fatuity. All the stats from the prefix and the suffix are added to the item as well as item levels 1+45+36=82

This is how item is formed.

**Interesting fact!** Did you know that you can't have certain stats on certain item slots in Gladiatus

- You can't have Charisma +% on Shields
- You can't have Agility +% on Chest Armours
- You can't have Dexterity +% on Shoes
- You can't have Strength +% on Jewelry (Amulets and Rings)
 
Example:

"of Suffering", i am using this suffix because it has both Agility and Charisma and is good for example but this applies to both prefixes and suffixes:

Agility +21%

Charisma +17%

![of Suffering](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/Suffixes/of_Suffering.png "of Suffering")

This is how a normal "of Suffering" items looks like:

![Amulet of Suffering](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/Suffixes/Examples/Amulet_of_Suffering.png "Amulet of Suffering")

However, If you decide to use it on an Chest Armour - there is no Agility! In fact there cannot be + "Agility %" on any Chest Armour in Gladiatus! No matter what suffix or prefix you use. You can have Agility +X but not Agility +XX%

![Chest armour of Suffering](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/Suffixes/Examples/Chest_Armour_of_Suffering.png "Chest armour of Suffering")

If you decide to use it on a Shield - there is no Charisma % on shields! Just like the Chest Armours are with Agility, shields cannot have Charisma +XX %. You can have Charisma +XX but not Charisma +XX%

![Shield of Suffering](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/Suffixes/Examples/Shield_of_Suffering.png "Shield of Suffering")

This is the same with Dexterity on shoes and Strength on Amulets!!!

So have this in mind when you are looking for the best item to help you max your stats.
## **Item Quality** {#Quality}
------------------------------------

Items come in 6 qualities. When an item drops it rolls the dice on what quality the item will be.

Standard (**White**) - Represents the base item. At lowest levels 1-10 **White** can drop from expeditions in Grim Wood but they stop dropping beyond it

Ceres (**Green**) - This is the base quality level of any item that has at least one Prefix or Suffix or both

Neptune (**Blue**) - This is an upgrade quality over Green. Every stats on the item is increased by 15%

Mars (**Purple**) - This is an upgrade quality over Blue. Stats are 20% better than **Blue**.

Jupiter (**Orange**) - It's very rare for an item to roll an **Orange** quality and these items represent one of the best items in the game. That's are 20% increased over the **Purple**

Olympus (**Red**) - Until 2015 the **Red** item quality only existed in the game code but had never dropped. With the implementation of the Forge in 2015 the **Red** items came into existence but are so rare that apart from Forging the % drop chance is so low that has not been recorded. Stats are almost twice as better than **Green** and 25% better than **Orange**.

**Workbench (repairing & conditioning)**

Item stats can be upgraded through repairing and conditioning. More about it you can read on the [repair & conditioning page](repair "repair & conditioning page"). Conditioning increases the stats of an item with the exact amount as it is the next quality color. A **Blue** item for example, conditioned will have the stats as if the item was **Purple**

**Green** + conditioning = **Blue** value = 115%   
**Blue** + conditioning = **Purple** value = 130%   
**Purple** + conditioning = **Orange** value = 150%   
**Orange** value + conditioning = **Red** value = 175%   
**Red** + conditioning = 200% value, twice as better as normal **Green** item
## **Item Drop** {#Drop}
------------------------------

Estimations are that on average the drop rate are around these values. These numbers are from a research on 20 gladiators and their own % drop over the last 7 years. **Red** drops are so rare that this number is mostly prediction while the other 4 for Green-Orange are pure math average.

    **Average**   **Green** 68.58%   **Blue** 27.40%   **Purple** 3.30%   **Orange** 0.70%   **Red** 0.01%   Now there are some specifics for item drops:

\- Expedition drop is situated at around 40% base drop. This can be increased with Dis Pater Normal costume (becomes 100%), different event buffs throughout the year, Secret knowledge of the artifact collector pact (+15%), Bubona's Bull Armor 3 piece (+5%)

\- Dungeon drop is naturally higher than expedition drop and is around 80%. This can be increased to 100% with Dis Pater Medium costume and different event buffs throughout the year and Secret knowledge of the artifact collector pact (+15%)

\- Dungeon boss always drops an item and the item is always at least **Blue** quality

\- Expedition bosses always drop an item at least **Blue** in quality but not 100% drop like dungeon bosses

\- Item drops from Expeditions are Soul bound while the drops from Dungeons are not and can be sold and worn by other players

\- Auction house can spawn items up to **Purple**, including Mercenaries although extremely rare

\- Vendors like Weapon smith, Armour Smith or Alchemist can also spawn items up to **Red**

\- Items gold cost raises with their level both when buying or selling them

\- Expedition opponent will only drop items with item level as high as you can wear even if it can drop higher in general. Example: Dracolich in Dragon Remains can drop as high as item level 134 but if you are level 113 he will not drop beyond what you can wear at that level, which is 129 (character level +16)

## Food (Usable) {#Food}
------------------------------

Some facts about food:

- There are 21 food items in the game
- Food can drop from mobs, be rewarded from quests, be purchased from General vendor, Auction house, Market
- There are "basic foods" and "complex" foods
- Only basic food is sold in the General vendor and the Auction house
- The "complex foods" are not sold in the General vendor and the Auction house. They can be obtained as quest rewards, dropped by mobs or created by combining certain basic foods (more below)
- Foods just like any other item can have prefixes and suffixes but they are not contributing in any way to how potent a food is
- Foods just like any other item can be in **White**, Green, **Blue**, **Purple**, **Orange** or **Red** quality
- How much a food heals for depends on: item level of the food + type of food + Intelligence + quality color of the food
- If you buy food from the other players in the Market, make sure it's not soul bound to the seller. You won't be able to use it if it is and you will waste your ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold")
- When you combine different quality color foods - the combined food will take the quality color of the receiving food. Example: If you are combining a **Blue** Apple and a Green Chicken the combined Feast will be of Green quality
 
The description of a food gives you the prefix, food name and suffix. It shows for how much it will heal you and how much of this is from intelligence. It also gives you a hint with what you can combine this food and the item level of the food.

![Food description](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/img/Food/Apple_stats.png "Food description")

**Is it worth combining foods?**

Well the short answer is Yes. Here is an example of combining two foods:

![Combining food](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/Food_combining.png "Combining food")

Let's look at the healing powers. Banana 3950 + Bread 6164 (blue) = Banana Sandwich (blue) 11231. On their own, 3950 + 6164 = 10114 which is less than the combed food sandwich 11231. It's worth combining food. They use less inventory space too.

Hint! Because of the rule that the final color of the mixed food is always the one of the receiving food, it might not always be beneficial to combine foods. If the receiving food is Green and the adding food is **Blue** or higher it might lead to less healing power. Especially when the adding food is higher than **Blue** quality, them it's almost never beneficial to combine them. Example:

**Banana** + **Bread** = **Banana Sandwich** = OK

**Banana** + **Bread** = **Banana Sandwich** = Could be OK or difference hardly noticeable

**Banana** + **Bread** = **Banana Sandwich** = NOT OK because the foods separate will heal for more than a green Banana Sandwich

**Banana** + **Bread** = **Banana Sandwich** = Better than the above, the final food will heal for less than individual but may not be noticeable

and so on. You get the idea. Sometimes foods might not be beneficial to combine because they become too power and will overheal you. For example:

**Banana** + **Bread** = **Banana Sandwich** = Could heal for a lot more than your total HP. Then it's a waste. This is even more true about more potential foods in general like Steak or Cheese Sandwich.

    **Complex foods**

These are created by combining basic foods or as drop from mobs around the world or rewards from quests

Follow this guide on what foods can combine. In-game you can see this as well by trying to drag a food and see if any other food in your inventory becomes green. See example:

    **Special food** {#Special-food}

    There is food that is special and does not drop outside of special events. Look at the [events](/events "events") page for more info.

    **Mulsum**

![Mulsum](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/img/Food/special_food/Mulsum.gif "Mulsum")

    **Rebellum**

    **Cervisia**

1 day of Centurio. Make sure you use your Cervisia when you don't have Centurio on because when you activate Centurio (even with Cervisia) you gain free expedition/dungeon points. So better to save your Cervisia for when your Centurio expires and then use it when low on expedition/dungeon points. It's much better than just adding 1 more day to your Centurio and make it from 14 days to 15 days

## Reinforcements {#Reinforcements}
-----------------------------------------

Reinforcements are temporary buffs to an item that will increase a certain stat. They only last a limited amount of time and are not permanent. Reinforcements boost the character stats, health points and damage. Typical for reinforcements and upgrades is that every color boosts a certain character stat. Here is the order:

Blue - Strength

Yellow - Dexterity

Green - Agility

Orange - Constitution

Purple - Charisma

Red - Intelligence

Just like any other item, reinforcements can be different quality colors and the higher the color the more stats it buffs. Also the item level of the item is contributing to how much stat it boosts. Reinforcements can be dropped from mobs or purchased from the Alchemist vendor or the Auction house under Reinforcements.

## Recipes {#Recipes}
---------------------------

Recipes, not to be mistaken for Scrolls are recipes that can be used in the Guild building - Library. A recipe can be activated for X amount of ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold") depending on the level of the recipe and can increase stats for all the gladiators in a guild for 4 hours. They are very close to what reinforcements are but are guild-wide effects. The higher the level of the recipe, the more stats it will increase but also the cost and cooldown will increase as well.

![Recipe description](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/img/Recipes/recipe_description.png "Recipe description")

The recipe itself does not provide a lot of info in its description. Only when put into the Guild Library, you get more info such as how much stats it will boost, how much it will cost

## Upgrades {#Upgrades}
-----------------------------

Upgrades are items that permanently increase a certain stats when applied to an item. The higher the item level of the upgrade item the higher the stats it will increase. Most upgrade items have a minimum item level that they can be applied to so be aware of it. Also, if you are buying an Upgrade item from the Market, make sure it's not Soul bound to the seller because if it is, you will not be able to use it.

    **Dusts**

Dusts are temporary 1 hour buffs that increase one of your main character stats for a period of time. Dusts cannot be purchased from Auction house or vendors and only drop from mobs. Please note that these do not exceed the maximum stat of your character, so if you are at the maximum stat this will not have any effect

## Scrolls {#Scrolls}
---------------------------

Scrolls are the recipes of item prefixes and suffixes and can be learned so you can forge items with them. There are a number of different scroll colors and variations but they are not tight or connected to the prefixes/suffixes they represent and are completely random. For more info on what the actual scrolls can be, go to Item Prefixes and Item Suffixes pages. These below are just the variations of scrolls you can find out there.

Scrolls can drop from Smelting (read more about it on the page) or from drops around the world. Certain Micro Events can boost the drop % chance for short period of time.

If you want to go to Scrolls for more explanation click [here](scrolls-recipes "Scrolls").

If you want to go to Prefixes and Suffixes, use the top menu.
