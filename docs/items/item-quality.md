## **Item Quality**
------------------------------------

Items come in 6 qualities. When an item drops it rolls the dice on what quality the item will be.

Standard (**White**) - Represents the base item. At lowest levels 1-10 **White** can drop from expeditions in Grim Wood but they stop dropping beyond it

Ceres (**Green**) - This is the base quality level of any item that has at least one Prefix or Suffix or both

Neptune (**Blue**) - This is an upgrade quality over Green. Every stats on the item is increased by 15%

Mars (**Purple**) - This is an upgrade quality over Blue. Stats are 20% better than **Blue**.

Jupiter (**Orange**) - It's very rare for an item to roll an **Orange** quality and these items represent one of the best items in the game. That's are 20% increased over the **Purple**

Olympus (**Red**) - Until 2015 the **Red** item quality only existed in the game code but had never dropped. With the implementation of the Forge in 2015 the **Red** items came into existence but are so rare that apart from Forging the % drop chance is so low that has not been recorded. Stats are almost twice as better than **Green** and 25% better than **Orange**.

**Workbench (repairing & conditioning)**

Item stats can be upgraded through repairing and conditioning. More about it you can read on the [repair & conditioning page](/forging/conditioning-workbench "repair & conditioning page"). Conditioning increases the stats of an item with the exact amount as it is the next quality color. A **Blue** item for example, conditioned will have the stats as if the item was **Purple**

**Green** + conditioning = **Blue** value = 115%   
**Blue** + conditioning = **Purple** value = 130%   
**Purple** + conditioning = **Orange** value = 150%   
**Orange** value + conditioning = **Red** value = 175%   
**Red** + conditioning = 200% value, twice as better as normal **Green** item
