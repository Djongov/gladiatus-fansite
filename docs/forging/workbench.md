Using the workbench you have a chance to repair your items. You won't be able to make any new equipment, but with the right raw materials, at least you won't have to enter combat with inferior gear. Are you short of time and materials? \*Ahem\* Just bribe the blacksmith. The things he needs to restore your item to its full splendor might be lying unused just around the corner...

![Gladiatus Workbench](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Conditioning/workbench.png "Gladiatus Workbench")

In the Forge, there is a special tab called **Workbench**. The Workbench can repair and condition your items. With the introduction of Forging, items received two new attributes: **Durability** and **Conditioning**.

## Durability

Items have a fixed durability that is higher on higher item levels. When the item drops below 100%, nothing significant happens. However, if the item completely breaks (reaching 0 durability), its stats will suffer and the item will perform as if it were one quality color lower (unconfirmed). If you have an **Orange** item that breaks to 0 durability, its stats will be as if it was **Purple**.

---

## Conditioning

When the item reaches 100% Durability, it can be conditioned. Conditioning increases all of the stats on the item as if it were the next quality level. Conditioning increases the stats of an item by the exact amount of the next quality color.

### Conditioning Value Increases

- **Green** + conditioning = **Blue** value = **115%**
- **Blue** + conditioning = **Purple** value = **130%**
- **Purple** + conditioning = **Orange** value = **150%**
- **Orange** + conditioning = **Red** value = **175%**
- **Red** + conditioning = **200%** value (twice as good as normal **Green** item)

This is huge and means that every respected Gladiator must take care of their equipment at all times and ensure it's always conditioned. Conditioning is increased to 100%, just like Durability with repairing.

**Important:** Even if you condition your item by just 1%, you will get the full stat increase. This means that it doesn't matter if your item is conditioned at 1% or 100%—it will benefit from the stat increase regardless. However, every hit made against a character can damage the item, so you can't keep it low on Conditioning as you will quickly lose the increased stats.

## Losing Durability and Conditioning

Durability is lost by receiving hits in every fight you do, no matter if it's an Expedition, Dungeon, or Arena. This can be observed in great detail if you open a Battle report:

![Losing durability](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Conditioning/Losing_durability.png "Losing durability")

You can see the total loss of durability from that fight and in each round what items have lost durability. Boots, Weapons, Amulets, and Rings are heavily damaged in most fights. Gloves, Helmets, and Chest Armors are rarely hit.

**Dungeon Tip:** In Dungeons and Circus Turma, the tank will take almost all durability hits because they are getting hit almost all of the time. Therefore, your damage-dealing mercenaries and healer might not need repair at all!

## Repairing

You can repair your items in the Workbench section of the Forge. Simply navigate to **Forge → Workbench**.

![Workbench](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Conditioning/Workbench_interface.png "Workbench")

If you drag an item, you will be able to see what the repair will require. Repair requirements shown are always for repairing the item to 100% durability and 100% conditioning.

![Repairing an item](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Conditioning/Workbench_interface2.png "Repairing an item")

### How to Repair

Repairing an item requires [Forging Goods (materials)](/forging/forging-goods "Forging Goods"). It works just like [Forging](/forging/general "Forging"). You will purchase the workbench slot and then you will be able to start dragging materials into the bench. **First two workbench slots** cost ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold") and the **other four** cost ![Rubies](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_rubies.gif "Rubies").

Once you purchase the slot, you can start dragging materials.

After dragging a material, you can see how much this material will repair the conditioning:

![Repairing](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Conditioning/Repairing.png "Repairing")

You don't have to put all the required materials in order to start repairing. You can repair with just one material invested.

Just click on the button: ![Work on](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Conditioning/work_button.png "Work on")

### Changing Required Materials

There is a tactic for how you can change the required materials in case you don't have some of them. Just drag 1 material, repair, bring back the item to the workbench, and the required items to repair might be scrambled among the rest. Watch this video demonstration:

## Repair Calculation

The materials an item needs for repairing are the same as the materials required to forge the item. How repairing works is that one forging good will repair X points of durability (or conditioning if 100% durability). How much one material repairs depends on the character level.

- **Level 9:** One material might only repair ~1,500 points (but items have less durability/conditioning at lower levels)
- **Level 112:** One material usually repairs between 8,000-10,000 points

### Example Calculation

These Lucius boots are missing 40% conditioning, which equates to 152,181 - 92,385 = 59,796. We require 6× materials to repair these missing 59,796 conditioning. This is 9,966 per material.

![Repair example](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Conditioning/repair_example.png "Repair example")

Let's insert 1× ![Scorpion Poison](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Scorpion_Poison.png "Scorpion Poison") **Blue** quality:

![Repairing](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Conditioning/Repairing.png "Repairing")

It will repair exactly 9,966 as calculated. Let's use 1× ![Leather](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Leather.png "Leather") **Purple** quality now:

![Repair example](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Conditioning/repair_example2.png "Repair example")

The 1× ![Leather](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Leather.png "Leather") added another 9,966 exactly for the total of 19,932. This teaches us 2 valuable lessons:

1. **It doesn't matter what material you put in**—whether it's Bull's Horn, Leather, or Scorpion Poison, they all equal the same amount of repair points
2. **Higher quality materials do NOT provide more repair points**

Here's the difference in stats between a conditioned item and non-conditioned item:

## Conclusion

Let's summarize what we learned about repairing:

- You can repair up to **2 items** at the same time for ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold"). If you want more, you can use the other 4 paid workbench slots, but they cost ![Rubies](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_rubies.gif "Rubies")

- Repairing an item is **quick**—if you repair a small portion of the missing durability/conditioning, it can take a few seconds. The maximum a repair can take is 30 seconds

- After an item reaches 100% durability, any further repairs will increase the conditioning of the item, which increases stats

- Conditioning the item with even **1%** will boost all stats of the item. Falling under 1% conditioning will remove the extra stats from the item

- Repairing requires materials (forging goods). How many depends on the missing amount of durability/conditioning

- Each material repairs an X amount of durability/conditioning, based on the character level and item level

- The higher the item level, the more durability and conditioning points it has

- The materials required to repair your item are exactly the materials needed to forge the item. However, only certain materials are actively required to repair at one time

- You don't need to fully repair the item in order to repair. You can only repair a portion of the durability and try again. In fact, this can change your required materials to more suitable ones if you do that

- When a repair is finished, the item will be sent as a package

- Loss of durability happens to every character (even dungeon/turma) who is being hit

- **Boots, Weapons, Amulets, and Rings** are the most damaged items

- Certain Micro Events or Dis Pater costumes remove any durability loss

- **Pro Tip:** Because it doesn't matter what quality of material you use to repair your item—save your Purple/Orange/Red materials for forging and repair using Green/Blue ones. On high levels, even Purple materials are fine for repairing as you are aiming for Orange and Red items only
