Forging goods
=============

What is a forging good?
-----------------------

Forging goods are the building block of an item. Different item prefixes and suffixes require different set of forging goods. They are also called materials for short.

Where do we get forging goods from?
-----------------------------------

Two ways of obtaining them.

**Drop** - Forging goods can drop from all mobs in the game. In Events, Dungeons and Expeditions.

However, in expeditions, almost every expedition mob has a very high chance of dropping two specific forging goods at 45% and at 25%

5% chance to drop one of the 4 materials that are considered base -

![Copper](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Copper.png "Copper")

![Wood](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Wood.png "Wood")

![Leather](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Leather.png "Leather")

![Iron](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Iron.png "Iron")

And the last 10% - drop any other material out there

Gladiatus Crazy Add-on shows this in a very good way. Example:

![GTK example](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/forging_good_GCTK.png "GTK example")

Lemures in Dragon Remains (Germania) for example has 45% chance if material (forging good) is dropped, for it to be an Amethyst and 25% chance to be a Potion of Perception. The other 20% are for mentioned above 4 base materials (5% chance to drop for each) and the last 10% are to drop any other material randomly. This means that you might want to go and farm a certain mob in an expedition more just to get one or two missing materials you need. Smelting is more reliable for finding a forging good than hunting in an expedition but if you have no cooldown or no item to smelt for this specific material you need and the market is empty, this might be your last chance to get your needed material. I will be pulling this information and use it below for all forging goods out there.

So to summarize: (again using Lemures as an example):

If material is to drop, then:

45% to be ![Amethyst](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Amethyst.png "Amethyst")

25 % to be ![Potion of Perception](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Potion_of_Perception.png "Potion of Perception")

5% to be ![Copper](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Copper.png "Copper") or ![Wood](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Wood.png "Wood") or ![Leather](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Leather.png "Leather") or ![Iron](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Iron.png "Iron")

and 10% - Any other material out there - random

**Smelting** - Smelting is the second way of obtaining forging goods and the most reliable one. More on the [Smelting ](/forging/smelting "Smelting ")page but in general, depending on what are the prefixes and suffixes of the item being smelt, exact forging goods can be obtained from smelting. **If you want to know exactly what prefixes or suffixes to smelt in order to get a specific material, continue reading.**

Forging goods quality
---------------------

As any other item in the game, the foging goods come in the quality colors of **White**, **Green**, **Blue**, **Purple**, **Orange** and **Red**. These are important as **White**, **Blue** and even **Purple** (on high level) you might want to use for repairs and conditioning and **Orange** and **Red** you might want to save for forging high quality items
