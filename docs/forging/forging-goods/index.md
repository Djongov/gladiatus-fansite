Forging goods are the building blocks of items in Gladiatus. Different item prefixes and suffixes require different sets of forging goods. They are also called materials for short.

## What Are Forging Goods?

Forging goods are essential materials used to craft equipment in the Forge. Each item consists of a Prefix, Base Item, and Suffix, and the materials required depend on these components. Understanding where to find specific materials and how to obtain them efficiently is crucial for successful forging.

## Where Do We Get Forging Goods From?

There are two primary ways to obtain forging goods:

### Drop from Monsters

Forging goods can drop from all mobs in the game - in Events, Dungeons, and Expeditions.

In expeditions, almost every mob has specific drop rates:
- **45%** chance to drop their primary forging good
- **25%** chance to drop their secondary forging good
- **5%** chance each to drop one of the 4 base materials (Wood, Copper, Leather, Iron)
- **10%** chance to drop any other random material

**Example:** Gladiatus Crazy Add-on shows drop rates clearly:

### Smelting

Smelting is the most reliable way to obtain specific forging goods. Depending on the prefixes and suffixes of the item being smelted, exact forging goods can be obtained. See the [Smelting](/forging/smelting "Smelting") page for more details.

Each individual forging good page below lists exactly which prefixes or suffixes to smelt to obtain that material.

## Forging Goods Quality

Forging goods come in six quality tiers: **White**, **Green**, **Blue**, **Purple**, **Orange**, and **Red**.

- Use **White**, **Blue**, and **Purple** qualities for repairs and conditioning
- Save **Orange** and **Red** qualities for forging high-quality items
