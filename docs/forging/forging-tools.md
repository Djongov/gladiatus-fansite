Forging Tools
=============

Forging tools are used to boost Forging capabilities. They can either drop from adventures although extremely rare or they can be purchased from the new vendor Malefica. They cannot be soul bound so they can be sold on the Market too. The forge allows for 3 slots of forging tools and with 4 type of tools in total, there isn't much of a choice on which ones to use. Forging tools come in 3 qualities - Gold, Silver or Bronze.

Certain [Micro Events](/events "Micro Events") boost the drop chance with usually 10% which can be really good, however only Silver or Bronze qualities drop. Gold can only be purchased from the Malefica vendor or in the Market from another player.

There are 4 types of Forging tools sorted by importance:

**Clover of Fortune**

These are the most important tools. Pretty much forging without them is way too risky of a job as the default forging % success rate cannot exceed 55% on its own without buffs. However, please note that the clovers increase the **base** success chance of a forge. If event or costume boosts the global % chance of forging, the clover is not affected by this. Example: Forging chance is 40%, an event boosts it to 50%, if you insert a Gold Clover your % will be 90% instead of 100%. This is because the clover will boost your base % which 40 - 40\*2 = 80 % (needs further explaining) + 10% from the event = 90%.

**Hint:** Also when you want to calculate how much a clover will boost your %, open a calculator and multiply by exactly the amount that the clover says. if 40% base - do 40\*1.2 (for Bronze Clover) = 48%

**Bellows of Austerity**
------------------------

Bellows is arguably the second most important forging tool you can use. It reduces the forging goods material costs and when you try to craft something in **Orange** or **Red**, this is of vital importance. If you have already invested some materials into the forge and you apply a Bellows, the excess of materials will be send back to you as a package so you don't lose it.

**Gold Bellows**

**Anvil of Calibre**
--------------------

Anvils add an extra % chance for your item to roll the higher of your possible qualities. For example if you are using predominantly **Orange** materials, the anvil will add % for your item to roll **Red**.

Anvil works very well when using only Orange materials for example. It will give you flat % chance for Red. However, when you are using multiple qualities of materials it will boost the highest % of the highest quality. Here is an example:

**Smith's Hammer of Urgency**
-----------------------------

This is absolutely the least important tool and i think it's rarely used. Well, if you are in a hurry, you can go for it. The price actually reflects this very accurately. It's few times cheaper than the other 3 tools and the fact that you have 3 tool slots makes this tool even more rarely used. Probably useful if you try a low priority forge or when you forge entirely **Red** item where you don't need an Anvil and you can occupy your third slot with a hammer.
