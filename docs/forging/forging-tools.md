Forging tools are used to boost forging capabilities. They can either drop from adventures (although extremely rare) or be purchased from the vendor Malefica. They cannot be soul bound, so they can be sold on the Market. The forge allows for 3 slots of forging tools, and with 4 types of tools in total, there isn't much choice on which ones to use. Forging tools come in 3 qualities: **Gold**, **Silver**, or **Bronze**.

Certain [Micro Events](/events "Micro Events") boost the drop chance by 10%, which can be really good. However, only Silver or Bronze qualities drop. Gold can only be purchased from Malefica or on the Market from another player.

## Tool Types

There are 4 types of forging tools, sorted by importance:

---

## Clover of Fortune

These are the most important tools. Forging without them is way too risky, as the default forging success rate cannot exceed 55% on its own without buffs. However, please note that clovers increase the **base** success chance of a forge. If an event or costume boosts the global forging chance, the clover is not affected by this.

**Example:** Forging chance is 40%, an event boosts it to 50%. If you insert a Gold Clover, your percentage will be 90% instead of 100%. This is because the clover boosts your base percentage: 40 × 2 = 80% + 10% from the event = 90%.

**Hint:** To calculate how much a clover will boost your percentage, multiply by exactly the amount the clover states. For example, if 40% base with a Bronze Clover: 40 × 1.2 = 48%.

## Bellows of Austerity

Bellows are arguably the second most important forging tool. They reduce forging goods material costs, which is of vital importance when crafting **Orange** or **Red** quality items. If you have already invested materials into the forge and apply Bellows, the excess materials will be sent back to you as a package, so you don't lose them.

### Gold Bellows

## Anvil of Calibre

Anvils add an extra percentage chance for your item to roll the higher of your possible qualities. For example, if you are using predominantly **Orange** materials, the anvil will add a chance for your item to roll **Red**.

Anvils work very well when using only Orange materials. They give you a flat percentage chance for Red. However, when using multiple qualities of materials, they boost the highest percentage of the highest quality. Here is an example:

## Smith's Hammer of Urgency

This is the least important tool and is rarely used. If you are in a hurry, you can use it. The price reflects this accurately—it's several times cheaper than the other tools, and the fact that you have 3 tool slots makes this tool even more rarely used. It's probably useful for low-priority forges or when forging entirely **Red** items where you don't need an Anvil and can occupy your third slot with a Hammer.

### Gold Hammer
