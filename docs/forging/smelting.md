In the Smelter you can melt down your equipment to earn resources. Simply select the item you no longer need and melt it down into its constituent parts. Of course, the smelting process is not without its costs, and you will never recover all of the resources which were invested in an item.

![Gladiatus Smelting](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Smelting/smelting.png "Gladiatus Smelting")

Smelting is the ability to smelt an item back to its forging goods (materials). It is the fundamental way of obtaining materials.

## How to Smelt

Navigate to the Smelter interface: **Forge → Smelter tab**

![Smelting Interface](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Smelting/Smelter_Interface.png "Smelting Interface")

Simply drag the item you want to smelt and start smelting.

## Smelting Facts

- **First two smelting slots** cost ![Gold](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_gold.gif "Gold") and the **other four** cost ![Rubies](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_rubies.gif "Rubies"). Cost depends on the item level and type of the item being smelted.

- **Duration** of the smelt depends on the item level, type, and quality. Orange/Red amulets at item level 100+ can take 48+ hours to smelt.

- **Scroll Drop Chance:** There is a small chance (~5%) that the smelt will also produce a scroll with either the Prefix or the Suffix. This can be beneficial to smelt items with Prefixes/Suffixes that you don't have but need.

![Scroll drop from smelting](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Smelting/Scroll_from_smelt.png "Scroll drop from smelting")![Scroll drop from smelting](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Smelting/smelt_scroll.png "Scroll drop from smelting")

- **Material Types:** What type of materials you will get from the item you want to smelt is entirely dependent on what the Prefix + Base Item + Suffix cost in materials to make. Therefore, the materials required to forge an item will also be produced when smelting the same item. However, smelting will not guarantee the same amount of materials needed to forge the item.

- **Targeted Smelting:** You can specifically target items with the desired Prefix and sometimes even Suffix to get the exact materials you need. The [Items](/items-general/items "Items") page can be very useful in that case.
  - **Example:** If you need Amethysts or Crystals, target Gaius or Antonius weapons and smelt them. You can even buy **Green** or **Blue** quality from the Auction House if you need Amethysts for repairs.

- **Material Quantity:** The number of materials you get depends on the composition of the item. If you are smelting Lucius, you will get ![Tincture of Stamina](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Tincture_of_Stamina.png "Tincture of Stamina") in bigger quantities because it is the most fundamental part of crafting a Lucius prefix (30× ![Tincture of Stamina](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Tincture_of_Stamina.png "Tincture of Stamina")).

- **Quality Impact:** Lesser qualities like **Green** or **Blue** will give less total materials from a smelt than superior qualities like **Purple**, **Orange**, or **Red**.

- **Farming for Repairs:** If you are farming for repair materials and you don't care about quality, search the Auction House for a [prefix](/prefixes/item-prefixes "prefixes") which you know will smelt into the material you are looking for. Try to choose item slots like gloves, helmets, and boots, which have shorter smelting times.

- **Material Distribution:** The number of materials you get from the smelt seems to be directly linked to the number of materials needed to forge the particular prefix or suffix. If the suffix being melted has Amethysts as the most required material to forge, you will likely get the highest number of Amethysts from the smelt.

## Quality Rules

### General Quality Rule

When you smelt an item, you can get the same quality of materials as well as **-1** and **+1** qualities.

**Example:** If you smelt **Orange**, you can get **Red**, **Orange**, and **Purple** materials.

### Multiple Quality Drops

You may get the same material in different qualities from the same smelt.

**Example:** You are smelting an **Orange** item which can produce Crystals. You can get 1-2 **Red** Crystals, 4-5 **Orange** Crystals, and 4-5 **Purple** Crystals from a single smelt. The same way, if you smelt a **Red** item, you will get a random variation of **Red** and **Orange** materials.

## Smelting Examples

Let's examine controlled smelts of **Orange** items and observe the results.

### Example 1

![Smelt example](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Smelting/Smelt2.png "Smelt example")

Smelting an orange 120 item level ring. We can see the possible smelting materials and on the right side what the smelt actually produced.

![Copper](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Copper.png "Copper") and the ![Scroll](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Items/img/Scrolls/Bejav_Scroll.png "Scroll") did not come out of the smelt at all.

**Total materials:** 36

The rest of the materials came in different low quantities. Both ![Amethyst](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Amethyst.png "Amethyst") and ![Obsidian](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Obsidian.png "Obsidian") came in two colors: **Orange** and **Purple**. No **Red** materials this time. Some materials came only in **Orange** and some only in **Purple**.

### Example 2

![Smelting example](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Smelting/Smelt3.png "Smelting example")

Similar to the above example, a couple of materials were not present after smelting, and four came in two different qualities: **Orange** and **Purple**. No **Red** materials again.

### Example 3

![Smelting example](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Smelting/Smelt4.png "Smelting example")

Crystal comes in 3 different colors: **Purple**, **Orange**, and **Red**!

The rest of the materials show behavior seen in other examples: combinations of Purple and Orange. Again, a few materials didn't show up in the result at all.

**Total materials:** 38

### Example 4

![Smelting example](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Smelting/Smelt5.png "Smelting example")

This time we have all materials present in the result! We even have a **Red** item and, just like with the Crystal above, in all 3 possible colors. Interesting that the lowest color (**Purple**) produces the most amount.

**Total materials:** 42

### Example 5

![Smelting example](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Smelting/Smelt6.png "Smelting example")

Only 1 item not shown in the result. No triple colors here. Just the usual combo of **Purple** and **Orange**.

**Total materials:** 32

### Example 6

![Smelting example](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Smelting/Smelt7.png "Smelting example")

Good smelt. Two **Red** materials. Both ![Sapphire](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Sapphire.png "Sapphire") and ![Obsidian](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Forging_goods/Obsidian.png "Obsidian") produce all 3 colors.

**Total materials:** 30

### Example 7

![Smelting example](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Smelting/Smelt8.png "Smelting example")

In this example we don't have any **Red** items, unfortunately, but it shows the exact same pattern as the other examples. Two materials in single color and the rest in 2 colors.

**Total materials:** 31

## Smelting Red Items

Let's examine what happens when smelting entirely **Red** items.

### Red Item Example 1

![Smelt Red item](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Smelting/Smelt_Red_Rags.png "Smelt Red item")

This is a very rare low-level **Red** item. It is only a suffix applied to the item, so the total material count is not high. From the 3 possible materials, 1 is **Red**.

### Red Item Example 2

![Smelt Red item](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Smelting/Smelt_Red_Ledpidus.png "Smelt Red item")

First, it takes **71 hours** to smelt a 126 level Red amulet. Second, the results are conclusive. When you smelt Red, you will get a lot of Orange, but you will have guaranteed Red materials from at least the top 2 materials.

### Red Item Example 3 (Zimbris)

![Smelt Zimbris Red](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Forging/Smelting/Smelt_Zimbris_Red.png "Smelt Zimbris Red")

Very successful smelt. All of the materials involved in the Zimbris prefix and the Retribution suffix are present. Every possible material came **Red**!
