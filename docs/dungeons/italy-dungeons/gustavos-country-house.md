Hidden deep in Grimwood, there is a path flanked by murky looking trees. A cool breeze of air gives every passer-by goosebumps. The dark presence of evil beings crushes all hope and the whole place is marked by an eerie silence.

## Wild Pigs

Now that the Lunatic is out of the way, remember to go SOUTH as directed by the quest: "Fight your way to the south". This means that you don't have to kill the 8/8 or the 10/10 Medusa.
