description: The Cave of Dark Intrigue is the fourth dungeon in the game and same as the Dragon Stronghold its entry level is a trap. The enemy levels are 24-26 on level 15 Entry. Quite tricky. However, if you are VERY well equipped on level 15 to 18 you should be able to fight off enemies until the boss. The boss however is another story. It's much stronger than the rest of the dungeon so you could find yourself easily in the position where you fight through the dungeon just fine and when you try hitting the boss you barely down him to half health. If you are in this situation you would probably be skipping this dungeon until you are able to kill the boss or cancel and re-start the dungeon when you reach the boss. That way you can at least fight the mobs in the dungeon for items. Gear up your mercenary with the latest gear and keep them as high level as possible and you can try to down him as early as possible

## Description

The sweet odour of decay streams through the cave's entrance and one can hear bones splintering. The wolf pack has assembled and is rejoicing in the gifts of nature. There is no safe way past the wolf pack, and whoever wishes to enter the cave system must first pit himself against the hungry wolves.
