The True Owner
==============

The True Owner is the Advanced Dungeon of [The Dragon Stronghold](the-dragon-stronghold "The Dragon Stronghold") in Misty Mountains. It is in between [The Last Resort](the-last-resort "The Last Resort") and [Gioll Passage](gioll-passage "Gioll Passage") with 2-3 levels difference. Knowing that The Last Resort is 14 dungeon points long this one is a real upgrade in any direction

If you are farming Captain Kratos in your previous dungeon you will only need a slight upgrade to be able to beat Gernasch.

**Description**

There`s always something special about entering the lair of a dragon. At least that`s what a courageous hero`s widow would say! Fame, glory and the dragon`s hoard await the brave. Jewels, gold, magical weapons and golden eggs from happy hens! The cave is covered in spider webs, filled with monsters, overgrown with poisonous plants, full of deadly traps and dripping with blood... fair play to those who don`t wish to enter, but then they will certainly win less fame in their lives!
