Hidden Grave
============

The long waited return to Italy. You feel stronger but are you ready for this dark dungeon? It's one of the most interesting dungeons in the game and one with a formidable boss. However, there is one thing you should know - the dungeon can be very long depending on the Skeleton Wall. Boss drops very good items and the item level drop here should feel like a fresh breath after you've stayed and fought for 10 levels in the Viking Camp. Beware, boss is hard!

Entry level: **60**

Dungeon points to complete: **8-13 (varies)**

Level on which you can complete: **Boss is strong. Very well geared you might be able to do it on 60-61 level. Just keep your Mercenary at high level ~70 and make sure you have no gaps in your gear. Also, probably a good idea to update your healer with ~1000 Healing so he can cope with the increased strength of the boss. Here is a setup of a Level 60 kill - [here](images/Dungeons/Italy/Hidden_Grave/Nekomar_60_kill.png "Nekromar 60 Level kill").**

Enemy and boss levels: **69-71**  
  
Minions item level drop: **67-73 ![Confirmed](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/checkmark.png "Confirmed")**  
  
Boss item level drop: **68-80 ![Confirmed](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/checkmark.png "Confirmed")**

Advanced Dungeon: **No**

Parent Expedition: [Ancient Temple](italy-expeditions#AncientTemple "Ancient Temple")

Previous Dungeon: [Viking Camp](viking-camp "Viking Camp") (Level 50, Germania)

Next Dungeon: [In enemy hands](in-enemy-hands "In enemy hands") (Level 65)

**Description**

The temple's old pomposity helps us to surmise how mighty the constructors of it must have been. The ascent is threateningly calm. From the inside you can hear knocks and aggressive muttering and swearing. Tomb raiders try their luck. Except for the two of them, the hall is empty. Besides the trenched hole a dirty fountain and a beautiful mural painting are the only eye catchers.

Nekromar

 

 

   
 

   
 

 

**Special abilities:**

**Round 1, 19, 37, 55, : Nekromar's axes are glowing a cobalt blue. The glowing increases and suddenly covers his whole body. Before anyone is able to react, his axes start hitting each group member.**

Mass damage for the entire group ~400-500 damage

**Round 2, 6, 10, 14 etc. every 4 rounds: Nekromar changes his strategy and no longer directly hits his opponent, but hits his neighbour instead.**

Nekromar will ignore hitting the tank and will hit whoever is next in line after your tank (depends on how you have placed your NPCs)

**Round 3, 20, 35, 51 etc every 15 rounds : Nekromar raises his hands to his chest, speaks the magic words and thrusts his hands towards the group. During the next 2 rounds, all attacks pass through him, but blood is suddenly splattering out of the open wounds of the attacker.**

All attacks against Nekromar will hit for 0 damage and also he will retaliate some of them back to the attacker. Nekromar counters \{attacking NPC's\} attack. \{attacking NPC's\} receive 50-100 damage.

**Round 4, 36, 67, every 33 rounds: Nekromar's back wings are starting to shiver and are suddenly covered in icicles. It is getting cold around him. A glassy layer of ice is spreading on the floor and heading towards the group. Everyone has a hard time trying not to fall on the floor. After 2 rounds, the layer of ice dissolves.**

Next 2 rounds the entire group (excepts the Tank) will skip rounds and will not attack

**Round 5, 25, 45, 65 etc. every 20 rounds: Nekromar spins in a circle and creates a magic swirl. A magical shield appears and covers the whole body of Nekromar. The shield will lose his effect after 10 Rounds.**

He casts a shield on him reducing damage taken

**Round 32, 54, etc. every 22 rounds : Nekromar speaks a quick incantation. Surrounded by a green light his wounds begin to close.**

Nekromar heals himself for ~1051 Healing and Critical for 2102 Healing
