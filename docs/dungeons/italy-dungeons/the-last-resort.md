**Description**

The old harbour is a hideout and meeting point for all sorts of rabble and shady creatures. And amongst the dirt and fish stench filled alleyways, Gnaeus Aurelius Flavio is attempting to flee from his just punishment with some of his followers. The senator, the emperors` former confidante, is being charged with treason and fraternizing with the enemy.  
  
He has to be stopped, before he reaches one of the smuggler`s ships and can escape with any knowledge he has gathered that could be dangerous for the kingdom.

Killing Gnaeus isn't the end! There is someone else behind the whole smuggling operation!

The whole operation is stopped so you now need to deal with the mastermind behind all this! It's the infamous Captain Kratos. You've never had a better chance on making him pay so you charge with full strength

**Special abilities:**

**Round 1, 9, 15, 21 or every 6 rounds: **A loud roar echoes from the barbarian`s throat when he issues a sweeping blow. The blade cuts through the air so quickly that it becomes blurred. No one had a chance of escaping.****

Mass damage to the entire group for 1400-1500 damage. The attack can double hit, crit or miss.

**Round 2, 11, 20 or every 9 rounds: Recognition gleams in the barbarians` eyes. He has spotted your combat tactic and is nimbly evading all dangerous attacks.**

Seems to be increasing the chance to miss an attack on Kratos, meaning that your attack can still damage him if they don't miss.
