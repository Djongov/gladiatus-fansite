As I have described in my [dungeon arc](/dungeons#dungeon-arc) every player hits a roadblock on level 78. So far you have been comfortably farming Fenrirson in [Gioll’s Passage](/dungeons/italy-dungeons/zagrash-fort-level-78) but at level 78 you find out that there is a new dungeon in Italy called [Zagrash’s Fort](/dungeons/italy-dungeons/zagrash-fort-level-78). By that time the Fenrirson items will not satisfy you anymore so even better to try something new. A while ago Zagrash was the last boss in the game so they made him pretty hard. At level 80, just 2 levels after Zagrash’s Fort there is another dungeon in Africa - [Fairground](/dungeons/italy-dungeons/zagrash-fort-level-78). However, he is even harder than Zagrash so you might want to stay in Italy for longer. The reality is that dungeons are hard and if you are a first timer you will probably be fighting lower dungeons than your level.

I created an alt recently and reached this point. Even as a heavily geared character I wasn’t able to kill Zagrash until level 80 and even at 80 I don’t kill him 100% of the time. I got messaged by **ENIGMA** from Server 28 UK who killed Zagrash a number of times at opening level 78, which is quite a feat of strength. Before the Charisma changes there was a tactic using 4× Hoplomachus mercenaries for their high Charisma so Zagrash would not double hit that often, but that no longer works to my knowledge.

## Tips for Beating Zagrash

- Use a **Grandmaster / Elite Spear** as Tank  
- Use your **own dungeon character** as Healer  
- Use **3× Samnits or Murmillos** (or a combination) as Damage Dealers  
- Look for **Gaius, Antonius, Lucius** items in the Auction House  
  - You can try for Ichorus too but don’t put too many of these on your mercs or their HP will get low  
  - Don’t go below **3000–3500 HP** on mercs  
- Strengthen your healer with good armor upgrades or constitution  
  - On your mercs, don’t wear items that lower agility or charisma unless absolutely necessary  
- Try items with **Dominance** or **Fire suffix** for more HP  
- Make sure all gear on all characters is **Conditioned**  
- Make sure your weapons have **200+ damage**  
  - Make sure your damage dealer mercs are doing **400+ damage**  
- Make sure your Samnits are the highest possible level for a level 78 character  
  - Samnits should be level **88–91** with more than **280 Dexterity** as base  
- Do not expect to defeat him **10 out of 10 tries** in the beginning
