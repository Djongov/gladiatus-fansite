The Dragon Stronghold
=====================

The Dragon Stronghold is the third dungeon in the game. Don't be fooled by the level 10 entry. This dungeon is hard. If you are doing a slower paced game and you don't level too fast, you will be able to fight in here on level 14-15 only if you have 4 mercenaries, all fully equipped with current item level gear. The drops are not much better than the On the Run but still better. The boss is not that much stronger than the rest of the dungeon so assuming you are able to fight through to the boss then you should be able to defeat him as well.

**Description**

There`s always something special about entering the lair of a dragon. At least that`s what a courageous hero`s widow would say! Fame, glory and the dragon`s hoard await the brave. Jewels, gold, magical weapons and golden eggs from happy hens! The cave is covered in spider webs, filled with monsters, overgrown with poisonous plants, full of deadly traps and dripping with blood... fair play to those who don`t wish to enter, but then they will certainly win less fame in their lives!
