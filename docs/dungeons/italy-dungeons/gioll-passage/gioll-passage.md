Gioll Passage
=============

Gioll Passage is the Advanced Dungeon of [The Cave of Dark intrigue](the-cave-of-dark-intrigue "The Cave of Dark intrigue") in the Wolf Cave expedition. It's one of the intermediate Italy dungeons in the mid-high levels and is probably going to serve you only a few levels. It has a strong boss with a strong drop. Real challenge fro the best of Gladiators. It's only 6 dungeon points in length so you can properly farm this dungeon. Boss drops are very good.

Entry level: **73**

Dungeon points to complete: **6**

Level on which you can complete: **Boss is hard this time. If you are top geared you can expect to beat him on 73-75 and you better do because the drops are good and the dungeon is quick. Now, here is a setup of the very minimum to kill him. This is a lucky kill that is 1 in 10 but at least gives you an idea of what you need in terms of stats. Mercs should be 300 or 300+ damage. All 80+ in level and full Dex. Healer should be ~1100 healing and tank must be full on Charisma and Agility. Here is the setup of the bare minimum to defeat him - [here](images/Dungeons/Italy/Gioll_Passage/Fenrirson_kill_73.png "Fenrirson kill on 73").**

**Description**

The sweet odour of decay streams through the cave's entrance and one can hear bones splintering. The wolf pack has assembled and is rejoicing in the gifts of nature. There is no safe way past the wolf pack, and whoever wishes to enter the cave system must first pit himself against the hungry wolves.
