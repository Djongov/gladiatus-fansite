**Description**

Who would have thought that barbarians were capable of building such a well-fortified fort? The towers are manned with archers and guards patrol the main gate. This is certainly the influence of the beaming Roman legion. Through the main gate one can recognise obscure magical activities.

**Quests**

1\. Eliminate the gate guards   
  
2\. There is a threatening danger that a rain of arrows is going to come down from the watchtowers. Sneak to the watchtowers and secure your way through the courtyard.  
  
 a. Capture the key for the towers from the patrol  
  
 b.Eliminate danger through towers

The fort is really fortified. No easy way to sneak in. You are afraid of the towers so without being spotted you take out the gate guards

Gate Guards

 

 

   
 

   
 

 

Once you take out the two of them you complete the first quest

You know there is no other way into the fortress but to kill all the watch towers. They are just too dangerous left alone. However, you have to do it silently and you need a key to do that if you want to sneak up the stairs and ambush. Just as you were finishing the gate guards corpses off, you hear the patrol guard rotating around the fort coming to the front gate. You have to attack, perhaps they have the key to the towers.

Again it is two of them

Patrol

 

 

   
 

   
 

 

Looks like the 2nd patrol was having keys to the towers on their chain. You pick them up

---

Now time to take off the towers. It's a lot of work but there is no other way into the court yard.

You see 2 enemies in each of the 4 towers. You go one by one.

![Phase 3](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Italy/In_enemy_hands/Phase3.png "Phase 3")

Medusas guarding the towers! Do not look into their eyes. Kill them in an ambush and from behind

Medusa

 

 

   
 

   
 

 

The first one down...

![One Down](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Italy/In_enemy_hands/One_Down.png "One Down")

The second one is down too...

![Two Down](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Italy/In_enemy_hands/Two_Down.png "Two Down")

Third one down...

![Three Down](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Italy/In_enemy_hands/three_Down.png "Three Down")

and finally the last one is down as well....

![Four Down](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Italy/In_enemy_hands/Four_Down.png "Four Down")

All the towers are neutralised so it's time for you to enter the court yard and face the barbarian leader before he does any harm to the Roman centurio.

![Boss](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Italy/In_enemy_hands/Phase4.png "Boss")

Trakovar

 

 

   
 

   
 

 

**Special abilities:**

**Round 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, or every 7 rounds: Trakovar`s whip smacks through the air and blue sparks fly as it hits \{Random NPC\}`s hand. He is crippled for 3 rounds.**

or if it misses

**Trakovar`s whip smacks through the air and blue sparks fly as his whips become entangled and his attack fails.**

The affected NPC will be doing insufficient damage for 3 rounds. This ability seems to be missing a lot.

**Round 2, 14, 26 or every 13 rounds: The end of the whip wraps itself around \{Random NPC\} and shackles him for 3 rounds.**

The affected NPC will not take part in the next 3 rounds at all

**Round 3, 10, 18, 25 or every 7 rounds: The whips mercilessly smack down on the group. It`s impossible to know where they will hit and therefore impossible to avoid them.**

Hits the entire group for 1200-1400 damage. The attack can miss some NPCs.
