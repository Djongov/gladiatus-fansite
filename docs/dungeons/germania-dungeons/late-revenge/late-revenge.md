Late Revenge
============

Late Revenge is a dungeon in the last Gladiatus expedition - Dragon Remains. It is the long waited new dungeon after Externsteine. The 10 Levels in Externsteine to reach this dungeon are more than a year worth of regular play. It is also the longest in the game which is not pleasant especially after Externsteine's 6 dungeon points to complete. However, the item level drop is significantly higher. Even to the extent that on Levels 112-115 you might not be able to wear the highest level items the boss can drop.

Dungeon points to complete: **18**

Level on which you can complete: **112. Boss is hard but you just have too much time to prepare for him gear-wise.**
