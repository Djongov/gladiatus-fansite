Viking Camp
===========

Viking Camp is the third Germanian expedition and it is a long and expensive one. Also, it is 10 levels long as there isn't any dungeon to move to when you hit 55 level so you stay here until 60!

Entry level: **50**

Dungeon points to complete: **11**

Level on which you can complete: **50, boss isn't hard but can drop some good Taliths gear. Here is a setup of a 1st time kill of the boss on Level 50 - click [here](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/Viking_Camp/Homo_Nautilus_kill_Level_50.png "Homo Nautilus kill on Level 50"). Make sure your Mercenaries are in the 58-62 Level range. Make sure your damage dealers are maxed or high on Dexteritty which should be around ~300 and your weapons a little bit upgraded compared to previous dungeon (around 200 damage on damage dealers) and you will have no problem beating the boss. It's easy compared to other bosses.**

Enemy and boss levels: **59-61**  
  
Minions item level drop: **56-63 ![Confirmed](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/checkmark.png "Confirmed")**

Next Dungeon: [Hidden Grave](/dungeons/italy-dungeons/hidden-grave "Hidden Grave") (Level 60)

**Description**

One can already detect the traces of destruction from afar. The village has been devastated and sits lonely on the coast. No fishermen are alive; no joyous children's voices can be heard; everything is dead. Suddenly multiple voices join together to form a song and the knocking together of beer mugs can be heard. From a safe distance one can see Vikings celebrating something..

As soon as you break through the Viking Camp gate you are surrounded by 7 Vikings immediately. You start slicing through

Continuing down the camp seems to quiet. You spot an ambush. You decide to attack first.

A weird creature attacks you

You seem to be ready to confront the Viking chief and see what is that horn behind him

![Viking Chief](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/Viking_Camp/Viking_Camp_phase3.png "Viking Chief")

You attack...

Viking Chief

 

 

   
 

   
 

 

and you blow the horn behind him and complete the last quest

Unfortunately blowing the horn awakens a creature that comes from the swamp and stands right in front of you.
