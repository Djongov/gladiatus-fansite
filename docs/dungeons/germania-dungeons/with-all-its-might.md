## Description

A mystical place that is filled with magic energy. An old rock formation, that is older than the Roman Empire itself. The Germanic tribes have gathered here to sacrifice a virgin, so that the leader of this place can summon all his power against the Roman Empire. You`ve arrived just in time, but the harbingers of destruction can already be felt

Kill all 3

---

Once all 3 Fanatics are dead you face more enemies. Now you have 2 packs of 2 Stone Guards in front. Attack them

## Stone Guard

![Stone Guard Stats!](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/With_all_its_might/Stone_Guard_stats.png)

At some point you will complete the Quest 1. You might not have to kill all Stone Guards

![Quest 1 Completed](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/With_all_its_might/Quest1_completed.png "Quest 1 Completed")

You will know this when the 3 Druids become available for attack

---

Now that you have fought your way past the many guards and completed Quest 1, you should attack the Druids and ignore the rest because you want to reach for the maiden before the Druids sacrifice her to the dragons. There are 3 Druids - kill them!

## Druidic Priest

Once the druids are done you managed to save the girl from being sacrificed.

You have the boss in front. A huge green dragon on the top of the mountain.

![Phase 4](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/With_all_its_might/With_all_its_might_phase4.png "Phase 4")

You feel strong and you charge

## Oak Lord

![Oak Lord!](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/With_all_its_might/Oak_Lord.jpg)

![Oak Lord Stats!](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/With_all_its_might/Oak_Lord_stats.png)

**Special abilities:**

**Round 1, 14, 26, 38 or every 12 rounds : Oak Lord makes the attackers unable to move for 1 round(s) and withdraws health from them.**

It's a mass damage to the entire group for 100 damage to each NPC and heals Oak Lord for the same amount

**Round 2, 10, 18, 28, 36, 45, 53, 63, 71, 79, 87. Seems to be very 8-10 rounds: Oak Lord breathes deeply and spouts a cloud of toxic fumes at the attacker.**

Another mass damage spell that will hit the entire group for 250 damage
