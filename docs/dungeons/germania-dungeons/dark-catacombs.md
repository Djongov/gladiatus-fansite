## Description

A short cry and then everything is calm again except for the gruelling cracking sounds of insects. The aura of the dead is like a slap in the face with a bull whip for all the visitors of this place. Hate, Wrath, Sorrow, Luck, Euphoria, Despair, Lethargy - it all wraps itself around your heart like a bell and constricts it. The first steps into the temple are the hardest and after that the menacing ban of extreme tension clutches at every intruder.

![Phase 1](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/Dark_Catacombs/Dark_Catacombs_Phase1.png "Phase 1")

## Skeleton Warrior

And with killing him you also complete the task

![Task 1](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/Dark_Catacombs/Task1.png "Task 1")

---

Let's go with the other skeleton next

![Phase 2](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/Dark_Catacombs/Dark_Catacombs_Phase2.png "Phase 2")

It appears that it is another Skeleton Warrior

---

Now let's kill the mutated Beetles as well

Go with any of the two

![Phase 3](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/Dark_Catacombs/Dark_Catacombs_Phase3.png "Phase 3")

## Mutated Crypt Bug

and the other one

![Mutated Crypt Bug Stats!](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/Dark_Catacombs/Mutated_Crypt_Bug_stats.png)

and you complete the last task from the Quest 1

![Task 4](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/Dark_Catacombs/Task4.png "Task 4")

---

With the first quest completed you move to the next one

**2. A chant begins.**  
Disturb the pagan ritual

You see five ritualists doing a pagan ritual. You attack them

![Phase 5](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/Dark_Catacombs/Dark_Catacombs_Phase5.png "Phase 5")

## Undead Priest

<div className="player_name_bg">

</div>

![Undead Priest!](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/Dark_Catacombs/Undead_Priest.jpg)

![Undead Priest Stats!](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/Dark_Catacombs/Undead_Priest_stats.png)

You slowly go slicing through all five and once you are done with them you complete quest No. 2

![Task 5](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/Dark_Catacombs/Task5.png "Task 5")

---

So your only chance now to find the cogs for the third quest is to look in the room.

![Phase 6](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/Dark_Catacombs/Dark_Catacombs_Phase6.png "Phase 6")

You see a zombie like figure, you attack.

## Priest Zombie

<div className="player_name_bg">
  <div className="playername">Priest Zombie</div>
</div>

![Priest Zombie!](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/Dark_Catacombs/Priest_Zombie.jpg)

![Priest Zombie Stats!](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/Dark_Catacombs/Priest_Zombie_stats.png)

and by killing it you complete the last quest and you are ready to face the boss

---

You've always known that you had to confront the huge Skeleton figure in the middle. However you had no idea how strong and powerful this skeleton boss is

![Boss](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/Dark_Catacombs/Dark_Catacombs_Phase7.png "Boss")

## Lord Aesteron

<div className="player_name_bg">
  <div className="playername">Lord Aesteron</div>
</div>

![Lord Aesteron!](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/Dark_Catacombs/Lord_Aesteron.jpg)

![Lord Aesteron Stats!](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Germania/Dark_Catacombs/Lord_Aesteron_stats.png)

**Special abilities:**

**Round 1, 12, 23 etc. every 12 rounds: Lord Aesteron hits \{random NPC\} in the head with the hilt of his sword. \{random NPC\} looses his orientation for 4 rounds.** This is if Lord Aesteron's attack is successful. If it misses it will be **Lord Aesteron swings a sword knob at \{random NPC\}, who knowingly perceives this diabolic plan and steps to the side**

This is a extra attack made by Lord Aesteron on a random NPC. If it succeeds the affected NPC will not take part in the next 4 rounds.

**Round 2, 8, 14, 20 etc. every 7 rounds : Lord Aesteron changes his strategy and no longer directly hits his opponent, but hits his neighbour instead.**

Just like Pyro, every 7 rounds he will not attack the Tank but he will attack whoever you have next in NPC order.

**Round 3, 18, 35 etc. every 16 rounds: Lord Aesteron draws a mirror in the air. All actions from \{random NPC\} are suddenly reversed. The spell loses its power after 3 rounds.** This is if the spell succeeds. If it doesn't it says **Lord Aesteron depicts a mirror in the air. The group is glad that nothing has happened.**

If successful, randomly affects 1 NPC and prevents it from taking action in the next 3 rounds.

**Round 26, 48, 70, 92: Lord Aesteron speaks a quick incantation. Surrounded by a green light his wounds begin to close.**

Lord Aesteron will heal himself for ~755 healing
