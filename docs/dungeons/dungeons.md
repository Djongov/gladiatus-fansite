Dungeons in Gladiatus are adventures against mighty enemies. You and your group of 5 will defeat legendary bosses throughout the game and find epic gear. All you need to know about the basics of the dungeons you can read it on the Game guide page and the dungeons themselves with all the details will be here. Just read on.

## Dungeon Facts

- Dungeons become available at level 10
- There are 25 dungeons in the game. Waiting for Britannia dungeons
- Dungeon opponents are harder than expedition opponents because you fight them with a 5 member party of your dungeon version of your characters + 4 NPCs
- Defeating the dungeon boss usually is really hard if you try it on the same level as the entry level, except for the first two dungeons
- Dungeon boss drops a minimum of **Blue** quality item with 100% chance to drop an item
- Dungeon bosses drop higher item level than minions, very often even higher than what the player can equip
- Dungeon monsters and boss share the same level range. Boss isn't higher level than the minions but is always far stronger
- Dungeon monsters within a dungeon are levels = Entry level + 9-11 levels. Example: Dark Catacombs. Entry level is 40 so all the mobs inside spawn randomly from 49-51 level, including the boss
- Stats of the monsters in a dungeon vary depending on the spawned level
- Dungeon monsters are known to drop **Orange** quality items more than expedition monsters, at least on low-mid levels
- You can have **Orange** drops in dungeons on lower levels but the drop % chance is really low. It becomes a little bit higher in [Externsteine](/dungeons/germania-dungeons/externsteine "Externsteine") (Level 102) and above.
- The quickest dungeon is Gustavos Country House (Level 10) 4 dungeon points to complete in Italy and the longest is Alpha & Omega (Level 120) in Germania with 20 dungeon points to complete
- Normal regeneration of a dungeon point is 1 hour 30 minutes for 1 point. With Centurion this is reduced to 1 hour for dungeon point. Different costumes can lower that even more or micro events throughout the year
- Dungeon points start at 12 and can become 24 with Centurion. [Underworld](/underworld "Underworld") medium difficulty costume prize can increase them to 48 dungeon points
- First really hard bosses are Zagrash in Italy at level 78 ([Zagrash's Fort](/dungeons/italy-dungeons "Zagrash's Fort")) and Papa Sasama in Africa at level 80 ([Fairground](/dungeons/africa-dungeons "Fairground")). These two bosses can really be a roadblock for you, even if you are decently geared. At that level (78 or 80) you will be comfortably farming Fenrirson in Italy starting from level 73 ([Gioll Passage](/dungeons/italy-dungeons "Gioll Passage")). Quick dungeon and easy boss. However, at around 78 you might want to go and progress and this is where you hit the wall. You can't beat those two bosses who are next in line and therefore going to Africa at 80 is a bit pointless. You just need to gear up and give them a hard time. The guide to handle this is here - [https://gladiatus.gamerz-bg.com/article?id=65](#)

## Dungeon Arc

The dungeon experience in Gladiatus follows the following leveling arc:

In short - **Italy -> Africa -> Germania -> Italy -> Africa -> Germania**. Here is how:

1. You start in Italy at level 1. Dungeons unlock at level 10 and you will be doing [Gustavos Country House](/dungeons/italy-dungeons "Gustavos Country House"), [On the Run](/dungeons/italy-dungeons "On the Run") and [The Dragon Stronghold](/dungeons/italy-dungeons "The Dragon Stronghold"). There is a 4th low level dungeon in Italy called [The cave of dark intrigue](/dungeons/italy-dungeons "The cave of dark intrigue") but it is very hard and you probably will stick longer with The Dragon Stronghold and then go straight to Africa. Africa unlocks at level 20 but you might not be ready to fight there as opponents are too hard so you might stay in Italy until around level 24-25
2. Once in Africa you will stay there until level 40 and go through different dungeons which will all be relatively easy if you scale your gear well. At level 40 you can return to Italy
3. Once in Italy at level 40 prepare for a long stay there. First set of dungeons are all nice, easy and loot is good. At level 73 and If you are decently geared you will find yourself farming Fenrirson in [Gioll's Passage](/dungeons/italy-dungeons "Gioll's Passage"). However going from there is where the challenge begins. You will be farming Fenrirson for a while and at level 78 you will want to progress to the next dungeon - Zagrash's Fort. This is the problem - Zagrash, the boss. Back in 2011 when Germania country was not introduced into the game, Zagrash was the final boss in Gladiatus. And he is hard... damn hard. Read this article if you are up to the challenge to try and beat him on current level - [https://gladiatus.gamerz-bg.com/article?id=65](#)
4. What makes the situation at level 80 even more complicated is that at level 80 you have the option to return to Africa and try yourself in the dungeon [Fairground](/dungeons/africa-dungeons "Fairground") with Papa Sasama as a boss. Problem is that he is even harder than Zagrash. There is a dungeon in Germania that opens up on Level 80 and is called - [Mysterious Laboratory](/dungeons/germania-dungeons "Mysterious Laboratory"). However, there is a problem there. Dungeon is level 80 but there isn't a suitable expedition to match this level. So in the end you will be stuck in Italy for as long as it takes for you to be ready to beat Papa Sasama. This could be at 85 or even later, depending on your gear and mercenaries.
5. The next dungeon after Papa Sasama in Fairground is [Under a Blood-red Sky](/dungeons/africa-dungeons "Under a Blood-red Sky") which unlocks at level 86. The dungeons is many times easier than Fairground so whether you have successfully faced Zagrash and Papa Sasama or not, now you are traveling to Africa for sure. You will be farming Under a Blood-red Sky for 4 levels until you reach level 90.
6. At level 90 [In the Heart of Decay](/dungeons/africa-dungeons "In the Heart of Decay") unlocks. Not a hugely hard dungeon but the loot becomes very sweet. Lucius starts to drop and some high damage weapons. Make sure you are geared enough to farm In the Heart of Decay and this dungeon will gear you up
7. Weirdly, at level 92 Fairground's advanced dungeon unlocks - [Sasama's last journey](/dungeons/africa-dungeons "Sasama's last journey"). It just 2 levels after In the Heart of Decay so you might not be ready to face the mighty boss in Sasama's last journey. Just take your time, there isn't any reason to hurry. Sasama's last journey is the final dungeon in Africa and you next dungeon is in Germania and is in 10 levels on 102. Make sure that you start farming Sasama's last journey as soon as possible. Item level drop there is high and will prepare you for the high levels (100+)
8. After a long fight in Sasama's last journey, (10 levels from 92 to 102) you will travel to Germania and face the first of the high level dungeons in Germania - [Externsteine](/dungeons/germania-dungeons/externsteine "Externsteine"). The dungeon is quick and offers high level drops and most of all - **Orange** drops will now be a lot more frequent than before. The bad news is that from Externsteine on level 102, your next dungeon is again 10 levels ahead - on 112. And another bad news is that the it will take you more than a year of regular playing to get from 102 to 112 so prepare yourself with patience and enjoy the game. It is very exciting at level 102+
9. Once you reach the long-waited 112 level you can now enter the last dungeon in the game - [Late Revenge](/dungeons/germania-dungeons "Late Revenge"). Item level drops would seem significantly higher than Externsteine and will reward you well if you are lucky with some more **Orange** drops. However, it is known that Late Revenge seems to be a lot lower in terms of **Orange** drops chance than Externsteine. Not to worry, by level 112 Forging will be a huge part of the game and what drops from the dungeon will matter but will worry you a lot less
10. Another 8 levels after (on level 120) awaits you the last (currently) dungeon in the game. The advanced dungeon of Late Revenge - **[Alpha & Omega](/dungeons/germania-dungeons "Alpha & Omega")**. However, you will be at a crossroad. To stay and fight in Germania and try yourself in Alpha & Omega or travel to the new continent - Britannia where the expeditions are legendary but there are no dungeons yet.
