In the Heart of Decay
=====================

In the Heart of Decay is an important dungeon because it will gear you up for the serious dungeons that await you on the higher levels. Gaius, Lucius and Antonius item level 100+ start to drop so you could expect to change your weapon and some parts of your armor here. Next dungeon is pretty hard so you will need to stay here for as long as it's necessary.

Entry level: **90**  
  
Dungeon points to complete: **15**

Level on which you can complete: **90. Very interesting boss. Apart from the amazing and terrifying look of the creature she also possesses unique special abilities. Go to the bottom of the page to look at them in detail. In general, the boss has an aura that reduces damage and healing of your group by 1% each round. This means that the more rounds it takes you to defeat her, the more weakened your group is. So prolonged fights are not good. However, Corruption will heal for 50% of the damage she deals. These 2 special abilities mean that you need to have a strong tank with good armour and blocking % and high dexterity and good damage on the damage dealers so they can defeat Corruption in as little rounds as possible. Corruption has very low HP ~6700 so in general the fight should not take longer than 25 rounds.**

**Tips: Invest in tank gear - at this point Lucius is widely available, although with not good affixes. Take care of your stats with non-Lucius items and get your Agility and Charisma full, the rest fill up with Lucius gear to get as close as possible to 50% blocking and 11k+ Armour. As for damage dealers. Even if you are wearing the same weapons that you used to defeat Papa Sasama, it's all fine. Max damage around 445-450 should be fine for this boss. Just upgrade the level of the mercs. Buy new ones from the Auction House that are level 100+ with high Dexterity (close to 350 base Dexterity).**

**Here is a setup of a level 90 kill with comfortable farming rate (sometimes you lose) - [here](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Africa/In_the_Heart_of_Decay/Corruption_Kill_level_90.png "Corruption level 90 kill").**

**Description**  
  
The scent of decay and corruption seems almost physically palpable at this place. Something evil has dug its way into the innards of this once flourishing harbour town and has swallowed up all the life within it.  
  
This disaster keeps spreading and bit by bit and it`s taking over the fruitful riverside. We need to put a stop to this terrible disaster...

Decay is once again spreading across the town but this time something far more sinister is going on. You go again. First, destroy the hiding Mokele creatures that are hiding across the town

![Destroy the Mokele](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Africa/In_the_Heart_of_Decay/Phase1.png "Destroy the Mokele")

You start picking them one by one

## Mokele

![Mokele Stats!](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Africa/In_the_Heart_of_Decay/Mokele_stats.png)

Once you seek and destroy all the mokele you complete the first quest

---

With all mokele out of the way you head to the town square where a group of undead decayed fisherman have gathered. You decide to disband they party and attack

![4x Undead Fisherman](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Africa/In_the_Heart_of_Decay/Phase2.png "4x Undead Fisherman")

## Undead Fisherman

Killing the fisherman completes the quest

Unfortunately the Harbour Master has been infected as well turning him into a formidable monster

![Infected Harbour Master](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Africa/In_the_Heart_of_Decay/Phase3.png "Infected Harbour Master")

You need to put him down

## Harbour Master Haru

![Harbour Master Haru Stats!](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Africa/In_the_Heart_of_Decay/Harbour_Master_Haru_stats.png)

You take your knife out of the creature's body and you hear a strange chanting

![Quest 3 Completed](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Africa/In_the_Heart_of_Decay/Quest3.png "Quest 3 Completed")

---

A chant like this is never a good thing. Someone is trying to summon something terrible. You have to put a stop to it. You attack the worshipers.

![Chanting heard](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Africa/In_the_Heart_of_Decay/Phase4.png "Chanting heard")

The priests are dead....but they have managed to finish their summoning ritual. What comes out of the water is the most terrifying creature you have ever seen

Just look at this....
