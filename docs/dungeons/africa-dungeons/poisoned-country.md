**Description**

The scent of decay and corruption seems almost physically palpable at this place. Something evil has dug its way into the innards of this once flourishing harbour town and has swallowed up all the life within it.  
  
This disaster keeps spreading and bit by bit and it's taking over the fruitful riverside. We need to put a stop to this terrible disaster...
