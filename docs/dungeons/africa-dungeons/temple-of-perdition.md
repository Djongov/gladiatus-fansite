Temple of Perdition
===================

Temple of Perdition is the first African dungeon. Entry level is 20 but you have to be really well prepared before coming over here. Extremely well geared you might be able to get through to the boss but killing him would require a lot more. I would suggest coming here in your 25th Level and really well geared or on level 20 but to farm until the boss and then reset. Minions are still good source of experience and items. Try searching for Rayols or Uróthiens items in the Auction House, they are really high in damage.

Entry level: **20**

Dungeon points to complete: **7**

Level on which you can complete: **Extremely hard boss. Minions are hard but still a lot weaker than Themba. If you are slowly paced, extremely well geared you might be able to down him on 23-24 level. Here is a screenshot of the setup of Themba kill on level 24 - [here](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Africa/Temple_of_Perdition/Themba_kill_24.png "Themba kill on 24 lvl").**

Impressive what the primitive Umpokta have done here. Sophisticated defence fortification and traps await every uninvited visitor to this place of pagan voodoo. For every courageous and overestimating adventurer this will be the time of their life or their death.
