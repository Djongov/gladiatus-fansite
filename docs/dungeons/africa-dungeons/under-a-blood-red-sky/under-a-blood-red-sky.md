**Description**  
Screams pierce the cold African night air. Another Roman family has been dragged out of their house and into the desert. Usually help comes far too late and there are barely any traces left of the unlucky victims. However, this time torchlight has shrouded the riverbank in a sinister light that allows us a glimpse of the ghostly abductors.

Once you kill all 4 you complete the 1st quest

Now that the 4 Dark Warriors are out of the way you run to the bridge but just before you reach it a beast comes in your way

It's just a beast for you so attack is inevitable. It appears that it is a Lion

You cross the bridge but just before you put the final step an Animal Master commands two Elephants to destroy the bridge while you are on it. You rush and manage to jump on the other side just before the bridge collapses. The Elephants come for you in ferocious charge

You complete the third quest after the Elephants

With pain in your heart you slay both of the Elephants although they were not responsible for the attack. The Animal Master is. Time for him to pay

In your pursuit you are confronted by 3 fanatic followers

Killing the 3 followers completes the last quest but something strange is happening to Shetu this time

After Shetu's body starts to deform, two watchguard tortoises charge at you!

You dust yourself off from the fight with the two tortoises and you look up. Shetu is not there anymore. You see a monstrous Tortoise in front of you

![Boss](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Africa/Under_a_Blood-Red_Sky/Phase7.png "Boss")

You attack

Shetu bin Seth

 

 

   
 

   
 

 

**Special abilities:**

**Round 1, 13, 25, 37 or every 12 rounds: Shetu bin Seth retreats behind his armour. For 3 rounds your blades cannot find a weak point to attack.**

It seems that i sometimes let the attackers do 0 damage

**Round 2, 10, 18, 28, 38, 46, : The more effort \{random NPC\} puts in, the more bored Shetu bin Seth seems to become. For 3 the effect of the presence of \{random NPC\} is reduced.**

Doesn't seem to do anything significant to the affected NPC

**Round 4, 26, 47 or every 21 rounds: Ominous dark clouds gather above Shetu bin Seth. Blood-red lightning bolts flash in the night sky and an unholy wind howls through the air, throwing stones and sand into the air. For 4 rounds every word is swallowed up by the storm. Sand in your eyes makes combat more difficult and debris has become a lethal weapon.**

The storm hurls pieces of stone around and hits the entire group for 100 damage and this is repeated for 4 rounds
