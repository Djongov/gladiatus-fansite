Abducted
========

Abducted is the normal dungeon of the Bridge expedition and is the second dungeon in Africa. It is a lot easier than Temple of Perdition so if you are good geared you might be able to come here at level 25-26 and be able to complete it. Look for Uróthiens items or Rayols in the Auction House. They are really high in damage and if you keep your Mercenary to the highest possible level, you will have no problem farming this dungeon.

Entry level: **25**

Dungeon points to complete: **11**

Level on which you can complete: **A lot easier than previous dungeon. Good geared you should be able to farm the dungeon including the boss on level 25. Here is a screenshot of a setup that is never losing on Shetu which means that even weaker setup should do the trick - [here](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Dungeons/Africa/Abducted/Shetu_kill_25_level.png "Shetu setup").**

**Description**

Screams pierce the cold African night air. Another Roman family has been dragged out of their house and into the desert. Usually help comes far too late and there are barely any traces left of the unlucky victims. However, this time torchlight has shrouded the riverbank in a sinister light that allows us a glimpse of the ghostly abductors.
