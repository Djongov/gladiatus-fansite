**Description**

*The Rhine marks the border of the Roman kingdom and the rest of Germania*  
 *as well as being the lifeline that allows for trade in the Roman provinces.*  
 *However, this lifeline is being threatened and the emperor's source of*  
 *power over the peaceful areas of Germania has become endangered. The*  
 *germanic tribe of the Batavi stretches from the source of the Rhine in*  
 *Gallia Belgica right into the heart of Upper Germania.*  
 *There is only one choice:*  
 *To your weapons, fight off the Batavians!*

Event Info
----------

**How does the event work?**

- As soon as the event has started a new expedition area will appear in your menu when you're in Italy.
- Clicking on it shows you the first wave of opponents to beat.
- In contrast to normal expeditions the enemies at the event have a counter, which shows you how often the enemy was beaten by all gladiators on the server.
- This means that the more active you and your allies are, the quicker you will gain the victory.
- As soon as all enemies of the first wave are beaten (= the counter reaches e.g. 1000/1000), the next wave is available to attack.
- At the end there is the leader of the enemies to beat, one single boss, but with an enormous amount of health points which all gladiators have to beat down fight by fight!
- From the start of the event you have 7 days to beat all enemies including the boss. If you don't succeed in that time frame, the battle / event was lost.

Expedition
----------

You have 16 Event expedition ![Event expedition Points](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/expedition_points2.png "Event expedition points") points every day with the usual 15 ![Rubies](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/icon_rubies.gif "Rubies") to refill them once they are depleted

 

Because the event is a wave-based expedition, at first you will only have Opponent 1 available to fight. He is the first wave. After defeating Opponent 1 X amount of times, Opponent 1 becomes inactive and Opponent 2 becomes available - Wave 2. Again after X amount of kills on Opponent 2, it deactivates and Wave 3 starts with Opponent 3 being available. After X amount of kills on Opponent 3 the boss comes. Unlike the rest, the boss is a single kill but with large health pool. When the health of the boss drops to 0 the boss is defeated and the entire event is completed. All the rewards then are distributed as packages/buffs/titles. This needs to happen within the time frame of the event.

 

![Event needed kills](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Events/Event_numbers.png "Event needed kills")

 

The X amount of kills needed for each wave are determined by the server population and participants in the event. If you are on a lower populated server, the kill amount needed to progress to the next weave + the health of the boss will be reduced

The math behind the number of required kills compared to other waves is the following:

Wave 1 - X Amount based on server population

Wave 2 - 70% of the amount needed for Wave 1

Wave 3 - 30% of the amount needed for Wave 1

Boss - HP is based on server population

Tips & Tricks
-----------------

- Event starts at 0:00 German time (GMT+1) and this is when the event points (![Event expedition Points](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/expedition_points2.png "Event expedition points")) replenish. Have it in mind. This is regardless of what is your language and server you are playing on
- Dis Pater's Normal costume **does not** boost event expedition points
- Level up **does not** regenerate event expeditions points
- If more than one players are on the same score, all are receiving the bonuses from this particular ranking, including the Total ranking. Talk to each other!
 
![Rewards for everyone](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Events/Rewards_for_everyone.png "Rewards for everyone")

- Enemy levels are exactly your character's level
- Enemies are very weak
- If you aim for one of the prize rewards or the total, most points are done during Wave 1
 
Server wide announcement is made when the 1st Wave is defeated

    ![Peasant Soldier](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Events/Conquest_of_the_Source_of_the_Rhine/1_39.jpg "Peasant Soldier")

When the boss is defeated the event is over and an announcement is circulated around the server and all rewards delivered

The event is also followed by a server-wide buff which lasts 4 hours:

    ![](https://s20-en.gladiatus.gameforge.com/game/9234/img/npc/imperator.jpg) **Sigurd has been caught!**   Rome's honour has been restored and trade can flourish again. Germania has been pacified once again. Long live the emperor and long live his heroes.
