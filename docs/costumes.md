Gladiatus Costumes
==================

Gladiatus costumes are giving bonuses to the one who wears them but with one rule - bonuses are not with direct benefits to the strength of the hero (it won't make you better at fighting)

There are 3 types of costumes:

- Everywear Costumes - The normal costumes. Can be found in Expeditions, Dungeons and Chest of Divine Fate or Daily rolls. Read more about them in this page below

![Everywear costume](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/gifs/Wrath_of_the_Mountain_male.gif "Everywear costume")

- Underworld Costumes - Are reward from completing Underworld in Normal, Medium or Hard. Read about it in [Underworld](/underworld "Underworld").

![Underworld costume](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/gifs/dis_pater_hard_male.gif "Underworld costume")

- Festival/Event Costumes - Festival Costumes are found like normal costumes but only during a certain event. They are also worn only during events. Read more about it in [Events](/events "Events").

## Everywear Costumes

Costumes are essential part of the game. They boost certain non-combat aspects of the game. They can drop from expeditions, dungeons, Daily bonuses or [Divine Chest of Faith](/game-guide#Treasury "Divine Chest of Faith") rolls. **Every "background" piece of every costume can only be found** from a [Divine Chest of Faith](/game-guide#Treasury "Divine Chest of Faith") roll.

Costumes are of several parts where you receive bonuses on 1, 3 and 5 or even 7th part. This is a complete list of all costumes and their bonuses:

(2) Every day on your login bonus you will receive +2 grace points from all gods. This is particularly useful if you don't do a lot of quests and you have no way of filling up your god grace

![Wrath Mountain's Scale Armour stats](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/Wrath_Mountain_stats.png "Wrath Mountain's Scale Armour stats")

**Costume stats explained:**

(1) Cooldown on attacking you in the Arena and Turma is increased from 30 minutes to 38 minutes

(2) Rank 4 Godly buffs cooldown reduced from 6 days to 5 days.

![Wrath Mountain's Scale Armour bonus 2](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/Wrath_Mountain_bonus2.png "Wrath Mountain's Scale Armour bonus 2")

![Wrath Mountain's Scale Armour bonus 4](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/Wrath_Mountain_bonus4.png "Wrath Mountain's Scale Armour bonus 4")

That's pretty cool if you add the Secret Knowledge of the Ancients the quest cooldown becomes 6 minutes!!! (for some reason)

![Wrath Mountain's Scale Armour bonus 4 - 2](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/Wrath_Mountain_bonus4-2.png "Wrath Mountain's Scale Armour bonus 4 - 2")

 ![6 minutes cooldown on quests](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/Wrath_Mountain_bonus4-3.png "6 minutes cooldown on quests")

### Eagle Eyes

![Eagle Eyes male](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/gifs/Eagle_Eyes_male.gif "Eagle Eyes male")![Eagle Eyes female](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/gifs/Eagle_Eyes_female.gif "Eagle Eyes female")

![Eagle Eyes stats](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/Farsightedness_stats.png "Farsightedness of the Eagle (Eagle Eyes) stats")

**Costume stats explained:**

(1) Your login bonus now gives you 1 additional grace point from every god

![Eagle Eyes bonus 1](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/Farsightedness_bonus1.png "Farsightedness of the Eagle bonus 1")

(2) Every quest awards points with a god. But until high level they are actually 0 points. This increases the rewarded points from quest completions by 1

![Eagle Eyes bonus 2](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/Farsightedness_bonus2.png "Farsightedness of the Eagle bonus 2")

(3) The Expedition entry level is reduced by 2. Now this on low level might not be something special but on level 106 to be able to visit Koman Mountain or Dragon Remains on level 110 means quite a lot. On these high levels you are leveling at 1month+ per level so seeing the next dungeon 2 months ahead is actually quite a reward.

### Juno's Breath of Life

![Juno's Breath of Life male](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/gifs/June_Breath_male.gif "Juno's Breath of Life male")![Juno's Breath of Life](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/Juno_female.png "Juno's Breath of Life")

![Juno's Breath of Life stats](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/Juno_stats.PNG "Juno's Breath of Life stats")

**Costume stats explained:**

(1) Healing items (Food) heal 50% more through intelligence then usual. Yes, food healing is dependent on intelligence and this costume boosts that

![Juno's Breath of Life bonus 1](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/Juno_bonus1.png "Juno's Breath of Life bonus 1")

(2) Same as Feronia's Shield of Earth's but here is double - 200%. Again that's not quite a lot. Probably at 3000/hour on around 300 Constitution

(3) Expeditions cooldown is down from 5 to to 4 minutes for Centurios and from 10 to 8 minutes for non Centurios

### Pluto's Deadly Mist

![Pluto's Deadly Mist male](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/gifs/Pluto_male.gif "Pluto's Deadly Mist male")![Pluto's Deadly Mist female](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/gifs/Pluto_female.gif "Pluto's Deadly Mist female")

![Pluto's Deadly Mist stats](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/Pluto_stats.png "Pluto's Deadly Breath stats")

**Costume stats explained:**

(1) Circus Turma cooldown goes down from 5 to 4:30 minutes with Centurio and from 15 to 13:30 minutes without Centurio

(2) Same as Eagle Eyes bonus 2 but this one concerns only Arena and Turma quests. Increases the godly bonus from missions +1

![Pluto's Deadly Mist bonus 2](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Costumes/Pluto_bonus2.png "Pluto's Deadly Mist bonus 2")

(3) Arena cooldown goes down from 5 to 4 minutes for Centurio and from 15 to 12 minutes for non Centurio

---

When using costumes that grant you the same bonuses, those will be summed when used!  
 For example:

Pluto gives you 10% cooldown for each attack in Circus Turma, and Vulcanus gives you 20% cooldown for each attack in turma. **That equals to a total of 30% cooldown for attacks in Circus Turma.**
