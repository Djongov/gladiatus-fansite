## Description

Dungeon bosses who have been found and defeated by guild members are incarcerated in Negotium X, which is outside the safe walls of the city. With every expansion level, the necessary preparations are made for the incarceration of 2 more bosses. Negotium X gives guild members the possibility to test their strength against captured dungeon bosses (until the boss is dead) without losing any dungeon points.

*Only the cleverest guild leaders come up with the ingenious idea of working at Negotium X. Everyone can have monsters and gladiators, but catching dungeon bosses takes quite some doing... or quite some craziness. The muffled sound of angry dungeon bosses echoes through the thick walls. The rocks are covered in claw scratches and dried blood. Now and again severely injured gladiators, who have attempted to defeat prisoners from the fort, are carried past you.*

*The Negotium X has got X cells at the moment and therefore has space for X dungeon boss(es).*

Negotium X is a jail for dungeon bosses. Whenever a boss is defeated, he is taken to the Negotium X where anyone from the guild, regardless of level can try himself in a dungeon fight against this boss. It is entirely designed for training purposes, however the fights are real so your items suffer durability. How many bosses the Negotium can hold depends on the building level. Administrators of the Negotium can decide if they want to release a boss from the Negotium to free space for another. Master/Admins can decide what guild ranks can attack the bosses, catch dungeon bosses or release them. The same boss can be jailed many times. If a player who tries himself against a Negotium jailed boss defeats him, he dies and frees space in the jail cell. The capture of the boss itself happens automatically. Whenever there is a free slot, any dungeon boss kill of a boss will automatically be taken to free cell.
