## Description

The Emperor does not want barbaric wars to take place amongst guilds, so he created the post of the War Master. The War Master's job is to make sure all guild battles are carried out according to the rules. He also has the job of documenting all guild battles before they are carried out. For every expansion level of the War Master Hall, he can store 2 more guild battle reports and 10 more arena battle reports for each guild member and needs 1 hour(s) less for his documentations.

*Your guild seems to have got the most grim looking war master of the whole country. His evil look surveys every person who enters his halls and makes it clear that he will do anything to make sure that the guild battle codex A.L.E.X. is followed. Two filing cabinets are at the end of the hall, one is labelled with the name `Guild Battles` and one is for all the arena battle reports of all guild members.*

War Master Hall serves the purpose of fighting other guilds and looking at guild & battle reports. From the War Master Hall tab you can search for an opponent guild to attack. On Level 1 the cooldown to attack another guild is 24 hours but with every building level this is reduced by 1 hour.

## Guild Battles Tab

![](https://s2-en.gladiatus.gameforge.com/game/9234/img/allianz/npc/npc_krieg.jpg)

*He mutely holds the guild war codex A.L.E.X. in his hands and points at the page with the rules: I. The Emperor demands that the guild Gods\_Never\_Die only fights with guilds that have a maximum of double the amount of members that their guild has. II. The Emperor demands that the guild Gods\_Never\_Die only fights with guilds that have a minimum of half the amount of members that their guild has. III. The Emperor demands that the guild Gods\_Never\_Die only seeks battle with guilds that have a level average that's a maximum of 5 levels under them. IV. The Emperor demands that the two guild war masters of each fighting guild alternately selects random gladiators for the duel battle. V. The Emperor demands that gladiators without opponents are evaluated as winners. VI. The Emperor demands that the trained Medici tend to the defending guild as soon as the battle is over and that the attacking guild, in the case of a victory, receive a fair share of the defending guild's guild gold. The vault should stay untouched at all times. Ave Emperor.*

The Guild Battles tab will show you a log of the last X amount (depends on building level) of guild battles and review them. When the limit is reached, any new battle reports will overwrite the oldest one.

## Battle Reports Tab

![](https://s2-en.gladiatus.gameforge.com/game/9234/img/allianz/npc/npc_krieg.jpg)

*The grim war master is especially neat when it comes to arena battle reports. He cuts out all the guild member arena battle reports that are released in the Roman Arena Gazette (tm) and sorts them according to their date. He throws away old reports because he only has space for 80 in the War Master hall for current arena battle reports.*

On the Battle Reports tab you can look at individual arena battles of all the guild members and see how they perform. This can be a lot of reports so the higher the building level the more reports you can save. When the limit is reached the oldest reports get overwritten by new reports.

Admins can also see an Administration tab and can say what guild ranks can start battles and what guild ranks can look at reports.
