## Description

The bathhouse is a favourite hangout for lots of gladiators. It is magnificently decorated, smells wonderful and provides a pleasant distraction after a long day of work on the field of honour. Idyllic harp-playing, a nice conversation in Vox Logus and wine from the winery "ludi officinae ferraria" all have a hand in increasing regeneration by 1% per expansion level.

*A marble etched portrait is prominently displayed at the entrance. It illustrates the scene of our emperor driving through the streets, on a victory parade through Rome. Hundreds of scantily clad women watch the emperor in awe, and in the guest houses countless suckling pigs are being served. Furthermore one can see Greek athletes running a marathon naked, magnificent chariot races taking place in Circus Maximus and in the background one you can also see a large area on fire that was once Karthago. This scene from recent history is often talked about in Vox Logus and a glass of wine from the winery \`Ludi Officinae Ferraria` is then raised to it.*

The bathhouse just as it says in the description is a place to chat and relax via the Vox Logus . It also provides passive HP regeneration for all guild members. Each Level of building provides 1% HP regen

## Vox Logus

### Vox Logus I and Vox Logus II

The Vox Logus lounges are where the talking and relaxing is happening. It is a place where players can write and leave messages for others to read. Often the guild Master and Admins use it to leave messages to the rest of the guild - like rules or donation schedules or tips and tricks. Unlike the Mass Guild messages these stick so imagine the Vox Logus as wallboard. Vox Logus I is for general use and Vox Logus II is only reserved for Admins.

Admins can decide which guild rank can write/read/delete messages in the Vox Logus.
