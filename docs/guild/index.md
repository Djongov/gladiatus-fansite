This is the page that will be giving the overall view of what the guild in Gladiatus does and what purpose each individual building has for the benefit of the guild members.

## What is a Guild

Players have the choice of creating or joining a guild. In this guild, members through joint effort will be building guild buildings that benefit all players in the guild. Creating a guild costs nothing. The only requirement is level 5. Once the guild is created it will start with 5 buildings - Forum Gladiatorius, Bank, War Master Hall, Library and a Bathhouse, all Level 1. The player who creates the building becomes the Master. Other players may join the guild by finding it and making an application.

Brand new guild looks like this:

![Starting guild](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Guild/Starting_guild.png "Starting guild")

and this is how a developed guild looks like:

![Developed guild](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Guild/developed_guild.jpg "Developed guild")

*This is headquarters of the [Guild Name]. All new guild members can have a nice bath in the bathhouse, introduce themselves to older warriors and generally find out more about the guild. Gladiatorius, the forum, is the administrative centre of the guild and is therefore also very important.*

### Name

When a guild is created it has a name and a tag. The tag is something like a short name for the guild or initials. For example guild name: Burning Legion, tag is \[B.L\]

### Homepage

A guild can have a homepage. This is essentially a link to external page that can be used as a guild homepage

### Guild Description

The guild description is a space where the admins or the master can put all kind of information about the guild. It will be visible to anyone browsing the guild. NB: Guild can be browsed either through another player's profile under his inventory or from the Highscore ranking

### Disbanding a Guild

The Master can decide to disband the guild which will delete it and all the gold will go to the emperor (nowhere)

### Joining a Guild

You can only join a guild from the same server. There is no cross-server guild join options.

## Guild Ranks

Guild ranks in a guild can be completely modified to your own choice but the default ones are:

**Master** - He is the owner of the guild. Awarded to the person who creates the guild but can be transferred later

So the master rank has full control of the guild and its administration. He can:

- Change guild description
- Change guild logo
- Change guild homepage
- Change guild name
- Administer members
  - Add/remove/edit of ranks
  - Approve guild applications
  - Change player ranks
  - Kick players out of the guild
- Disband the guild
- Start building expansions

**Admin** - Admins are powerful members of the guild who can do everything that the master can, except kick the Master. They can kick other Admins.

**Member** - this is just a normal member who can use the guild buildings and their benefit but cannot make any changes to the guild organization

## Guild Buildings

Guild buildings are all the guild is about. They are very expensive for the individual player so the idea is that everyone donates into the guild bank, the gold will stay in the guild vault and the money will be ready to be used for building. Once the gold needed to construct a building is in the guild bank, the construction itself is instant. There is a discount available on the price of guild buildings. It is 3% of the price per 1 player with Centurio with a maximum of 30% cost reduction. This means that 10 players with Centurio activated in the guild will provide the max discount for buildings. There are 12 buildings and each building has up to 20 Levels. Not all buildings can reach level 20. Each level costs more to expand. At higher levels the buildings are so expensive that by the time the gold is accumulated into the bank, the guild is exposed to attack from another guild and part of this gold can be lost so there are different tactic in how players organize to make the payments. Some guilds decide on a specific date and hour and everyone donates at the same time or players package the donation gold to the admins and they do it when the needed sum is gathered.
