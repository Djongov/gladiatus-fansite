## Description

The templum is consecrated to all the great gods. Every guild member can secure support from a divinity of his choice. The temple director can give each guild member 1 more hours of prayer time per upgrade level. During prayer the believer feels the divine presence of his divinity and the divine blessing associated with it.

*The monotone singsong of the prayers, the torches, the divine insignia and the scent of the mix of prayer herbs grants the temple a very special aura. A small shrine has been lovingly arranged for each grand God. The question is: What are you here to pray for?*

Templum (Temple) is a building devoted to praying to the gods. You can pray to any of the 6 gods and you can pray for god's favor. This is just another way of obtaining god's favor of your choice. 1 Hour praying time rewards 1 Favour with the selected god. It resembles going to work. You cannot do anything else while praying. The higher the Building level the more hours you can pray. Actually the building level corresponds exactly to the number of hours players will be available to pray.

## Pray for the Underworld

*You can summon Proserpina's mother Ceres through prayer here. Your praying will then decide how much Ceres will support you against Dīs Pater on the next day in the Underworld. For the injustice of what was done to her daughter, the goddess of fertility provides all with a regeneration buff - in full knowledge that healing is only possible in this manner. Dīs Pater should never be allowed to keep someone in the Underworld through the consumption of food ever again.*

This is basically the way to increase HP regeneration in the Underworld. Praying for X amount of time will provide X amount + % on HP regeneration. Note that the bonus regeneration from praying will be available the next day (Server time 00:00 +).

You can end praying whenever you want but while you pray - it is just like praying to the gods or going to work. You cannot do anything else.
