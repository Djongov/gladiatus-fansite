## Description

The guild's warehouse is very strictly administrated. Quest- and soul bound items are completely out of place here. Every person who stores something here or wants to take something with him or her is watched like a hawk; after all, no one is supposed to get hold of items that aren't consistent with his or her reputation. With every level, space is made for one shelf. The emperor only allows a maximum of 12 shelves in each guild district of a guild.

Warehouse's purpose is to store items. Items that you want to share with other guild mates or just to get them out of your bags. The space available for storage depends on the building level. Each level provides 1 "Shelf" with a maximum of 12 shelves. This is what a shelf is:

24 (6x4) slot storage space:

If you upgrade to Level 2, the second half will be available too for a total of 48 slots (6x8) which can now be filled with Mercenary or Forging goods or Grindstones

When you hover your mouse over an item that is stored in the Warehouse you will see who is the owner.

## Access Log

On the Administration tab you can see Access log very similar to the one in the Guild market.

Deposit an item is in green - 18.05.2018 08:19: Black\_Hawk has put Shadow Rune into the warehouse. (Amount: 11)

Withdrawing an item is in red - 18.05.2018 08:19: Black\_Hawk has taken Shadow Rune from the warehouse. (Amount: 10)

Admins can also administrate what guild ranks can put or withdraw items.

**Important note!** In order to reduce buffing of other players with items, warehouse withdraws also have item level limit. Same as Market limit, **items more than 9 levels above your character level will be in Red and cannot be withdrawn.**
