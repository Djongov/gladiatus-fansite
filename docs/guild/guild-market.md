## Description

The guild market enables tough gladiators to do their shopping in peace without any competitors around. Only guild members are allowed to stroll around and survey the goods here. The emperor puts a market administrator in charge of each guild. He makes sure that the emperor gets his cut and that all trade regulations of the trade codex A.N.D.I. are complied with. For every expansion level, a new market stall is built so that every guild member can offer 2 more items

*It's really nice to go out in the sunshine and see some familiar faces at the market. Exempt from the world of the battle for the best items for a few hours, you can have a nice chitchat with other people at the market. Even the Emperor's market administrator enjoys a good joke, though he always has the trade codex A.N.D.I. with him.*

*You can see items from level 0 to Character Level +9*

So the Guild market is just like the public Market but only guild members can see it. It is primarily used for re-packaging gold or exchanging scrolls. It doesn't work well for buffing other players by giving them items because the visibility on the market is only +9 levels above the character level. This is very low as the normal visibility of a character is +16.

The market fees are just like the normal Market.

when put on 2h duration: 2%

when put on 8 h duration: 3%

when put on 24h duration: 4%

However, this time the gold from fees goes into the Guild Bank instead of the Emperor. This is a good motivator for not asking for fees when re-packing gold for a guild mate.

The amount of items 1 player can put increases with building level. 1 Level = 2 Items

## Access Log

The Guild market keeps a strict log of all the transactions there. They are in the manner of: "18.05.2018 12:25: XXX sold Dragon ring to YYY for 2300000 Gold." The Access log is in the Administration tab but is visible to all guild members.

## Rights System

Admins can also decide what guild ranks can buy and sell items on the market.
