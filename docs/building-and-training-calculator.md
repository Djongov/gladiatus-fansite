# Training and Building Calculator

:::warning This page needs to be converted
This calculator contains interactive HTML/JavaScript that needs to be converted to a React component to work in Docusaurus.
:::

<!-- 
The original calculator code has been temporarily disabled.
It needs to be rewritten as a React component.

Original version notes:
- Version 1.1
- Features: Building and training calculations with discount support
- Known Issues: Neptune checkbox calculations, discount field display

TODO: Convert this to a React component
-->  

- Added the **"Further discount %"** as requested by fans. You can now use it to further add discounts like from events, Microevents, costumes
- Made some improvements on the visuals
- Changed some variables to be more readable and commented the code

**Current Issues:**

- Neptune checkbox still makes wrong calculation
- Discount field does not properly calculate how much you have been discounted (only optic issue)
- Total % Discount: is a new implementation and doesn't currently work

**Training calculator:**

<!-- 
HTML table and JavaScript removed - needs to be converted to React component
