# Character Planner

This is early BETA. Here are some issues you may encounter:

- Have not figured out how to know if an item is conditioned or not when importing a profile, so until I find a way, all items will be considered conditioned for Characters level >= 80 and non-conditioned for lower levels.
- I have not tested enough when importing non-english profiles, so there may be issues.
- Armour calculations are still pending so they will be wrong
- Some substats are missing and will be added later
