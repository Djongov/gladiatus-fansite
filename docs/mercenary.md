General Info
------------

In Gladiatus a mercenary is a NPC fighting unit that participates in [dungeons](/dungeons "Gladiatus Dungeons") and Circus Turma. Mercenary come in 3 types - Tanks, Healers and Damage Dealers.

You can spot them by their Icons

![Tank Mercenary](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Tank.png "Tank Mercenary") - Tanks

![Heal Mercenary](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Healer.png "Heal Mercenary") - Healers

![Damage Mercenary](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Damage.png "Damage Mercenary") - Damage Dealers

Mercenaries are just like any other item in Gladiatus - they come in different qualities. **Green** and **Blue** being the most common and very rarely **Purple**. Insanely rare are **Orange** and **Red** are so rare that few have ever been seen. If anyone sees a Red mercenary, please send a screenshot on the email in the [About me](/about-me "About me") page.

Here is one screenshot of a **Red** Druid Master although in foreign language

Where do i get them from?
-------------------------

Mercenary are obtained in 2 ways. One is to buy them from the Mercenary vendor. Lately it is vital way to obtain Mercenary and probably if you are looking for **Purple** or **Orange** this would be the only credible source to buy one by refreshing the New Goods using clothing. It is reported that **Red** mercenaries are also sold at the vendors but they are a lot more rare even than **Orange**

![New goods](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/New_goods.png "New goods")

People usually have more than 300x ![Work Clothes](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Startup_guide/Work_Clothes.png "Work Clothes") can just click and waste 200 or 250 of them on refreshing the market and see what it comes out. One example of an **Orange** mercenary:

Mercenary tactics
-----------------

Link to [Mercenary ](Mercenary "Mercenary ")page, describing all of the Mercenary types

There are many types of [Mercenary](Mercenary "Mercenary") in the game now but there are tactics that are established and well known to be working for years. For example, **Samnits** are the most popular damage dealer and **Grandmaster** or **Elite Spear** are the best tanks or on high levels - healers. I will use Mercs short from Mercenaries a lot. Mercs do not drop from mobs so the only way for you to obtain one is to buy them from the Mercenaries vendor, the Auction House (AH) or the Market. The Mercenaries vendor sells generally lower level of mercs, leaving AH as the more credible source. However, the Mercenary vendor can sometimes spawn **Purple** or even **Orange** mercenary. That rarely happens in AH. And this is an advice for all levels - make sure to regularly scan the AH and keep your mercs at the appropriate level to your character. You cannot progress if your mercs are outdated.

**Low level - (10-30)** At low level there aren't any specific mercs that are preferable to others. Just the highest level you can obtain really. Your own character can be used for either healing or damage dealing. He will **not be efficient as Tank**. Depending on how good your stats are will determine whether you will be **healer or damage dealer**. If you are what they call **"Twink"** (highly geared low level, usually an alt character of a high level player) you might go for damage dealer but if you aren't try healing. At around level 20 try and go for Samnit mercs or Murmillo with as much Dexterity as possible. Samnit and Murmillo are pretty similar, they are both high dexterity damage dealers but the Murmillo is usually with a bit less Dexterity and more Charisma and HP. Murmillo seems to be a bit more suitable for low levels. By the time you defeat **Themba** in [Temple of Perdition](/dungeons/africa-dungeons "Temple of Perdition") which is the first dungeon in **Africa** and a very big obstacle, everything will start to run smoother. **Conditioning** of your gear and especially of your weapons is essential even on low level. **No need for forging** yet so make sure to smelt gear every now and then and collect the forging goods for repairs and conditioning. Early prefixes that are really high in damage are Sugos arond level 20 and when you are near 27-28 start looking for Uróthiens and Raylos items. Some good suffixes early on with + damage are "of Demolition, of Meat, of Martial Arts, of Assassination".

#### Optimal Mercs

![Tank](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Tank.png "Tank") - Grandmaster or Hoplomachus or Elite Spear

![Healer](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Healer.png "Healer") - Your character

![Damage Dealer](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Damage.png "Damage Dealer") 1 - Samnit or Murmillo or any other high level blue quality damage dealer

![Damage Dealer](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Damage.png "Damage Dealer") 2 - Murmillo

![Damage Dealer](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Damage.png "Damage Dealer") 3 - Scorpion Warrior or Archer

**Mid level - (30-78)** If you keep your merc levels high and up to date with your growing character levels and if you gear them up well and keep their gear and conditioning, you will progress easily through all the dungeons in the mid levels. You can keep the same tactic of using your character for healing and using an **Elite spear** or **Grandmaster** for tanking. Damage dealers can still be predominantly a mix of **Murmillo** and **Samnit** but try to focus on Samnits as you reach level 70. Taliths is the strongest item prefix that you can utilize during your time in the mid levels. Taliths starts from level 55. At level 30,

#### Optimal Mercs

![Tank](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Tank.png "Tank") - Grandmaster or Elite Spear

![Healer](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Healer.png "Healer") - Your character

![Damage Dealer](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Damage.png "Damage Dealer") 1 - Samnit

![Damage Dealer](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Damage.png "Damage Dealer") 2 - Samnit

![Damage Dealer](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Damage.png "Damage Dealer") 3 - Samnit or Murmillo

**Mid level struggle (78-86)** This is a very specific level range. Using this guide, at Level 78 you will feel invincible in your dungeons and always farming the highest level bosses. However, at level 78 you will hit the **Zagrash roadblock** which is described in this article - [https://gladiatus.gamerz-bg.com/article?id=65](#). Make sure you have **top level mercs**, weapons with **200+ dmg** or more while conditioned and some little twerks described in the **guide.** Make sure you use Ichorus items but beware of having too many of those as they really lower the HP of your mercs, thus making problems defeating your enemies.

#### Optimal Mercs

![Tank](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Tank.png "Tank") - Grandmaster or Elite Spear

![Healer](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Healer.png "Healer") - Your character

![Damage Dealer](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Damage.png "Damage Dealer") 1 - Samnit

![Damage Dealer](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Damage.png "Damage Dealer") 2 - Samnit

![Damage Dealer](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Damage.png "Damage Dealer") 3 - Samnit / high level at least blue Murmillo

**High level (90-112)** Game now runs at a very slow pace. You have time to prepare yourself for the next dungeon as the next dungeon is usually weeks or months ahead. Also at this level **Forging** becomes a valuable source of gear and your character will become very **very powerful**, especially at **102+ when you depart for Germania**. There can be a change of tactics here which might become more relevant once you hit 102 and go to Germania and start farming **Wrath of the Mountain** in [Externsteine](/dungeons/germania-dungeons "Externsteine"). The idea is that your character can now be more efficient as a **Tank**, therefore your own character becoming a Tank and hiring a **healing merc to do the healing - Medicine Man preferred**. High level Intelligence healer merc with good agility as the healer would need to be strong not only in heals but in survivability.

In terms of items, in early 90s you would want to start replacing your Ichorus items with Antonius or Gaius because of the Critical hit value the Ichorus items are missing. You might have problems maxing your Dexterity on your Samnits if you use only Antonius/Gaius gear so leave 1 or 2 Ichorus or 1 Taliths item to boost your Dexterity. Just be aware of leaving your Mercenary on too low HP because of the Ichorus items. After level 100 you will be able to have Antonius and Gaius items with extra suffixes so it will be possible to accumulate Gaius and Antonius items with Dexterity and Strength, not just pure Antonius/Gaius, and other stats so this is where your Mercenary will become really really powerful and will help you defeat Wrath of the Mountain. You just need high damage, max Dexterity on your Samnits and high Critical hit value. At least 30% each.

#### Optimal Mercs

![Tank](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Tank.png "Tank") - Your character

![Healer](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Healer.png "Healer") - Medicine Man

![Damage Dealer](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Damage.png "Damage Dealer") 1 - Samnit

![Damage Dealer](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Damage.png "Damage Dealer") 2 - Samnit

![Damage Dealer](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Merc_Damage.png "Damage Dealer") 3 - Samnit

**Highest levels (112-∞)** This is where you encounter the last dungeon in the game in its normal ([Late Revenge](/dungeons/germania-dungeons "Late Revenge")) and advanced versions (**[Alpha & Omega](/dungeons/germania-dungeons "Alpha & Omega")**). By the time you run [Externsteine](/dungeons/germania-dungeons/externsteine "Externsteine") from 102 to 112 it's probably years of preparation so you will most likely experience no problems defeating the new bosses but i've seen most players including me make a change in their setup and the change is the character becoming the Tank. The healer now needs to be more tough and is usually performed by a tanking merc such as Elite Spear or Grand Master. The decision to switch to a tank healer is that on higher levels, especially 120+ the mercenary damage dealers start to do such a huge damage that they could easily one shot a healer with a critical strike so players start to choose a tank to heal and although he will heal for less because of his low Intelligence, it seems that the sacrifice in healing is justified for the increased toughness.

For damage dealer we are focusing on Samnits again but in **Purple** quality Scorpion Warrior becomes really strong (example [here](https://gladiatusfansite.blob.core.windows.net/images/Mercenary/Damage/Epic_Scorpion_Warrior_stats.png "Purple Scorpion Warrior")) where a 127 level Scorpion Warrior can have 3 stats at 400+ making far more stronger than any **Blue** quality Samnit/Murmillo. If you come across a **Purple** Murmillo or a Samnit, use it too, you are lucky!
